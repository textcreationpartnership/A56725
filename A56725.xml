            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IT was far from my Thoughts that theſe firſt Draughts of mine, which I only intended as Minutes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for a more skilful Pen-man; ſhould ever have ſhewed themſelves to the World, had not the backwardneſs of ſome, and the importunity of others, driven me to the <hi>Orator</hi>'s Reſolution; who ſaith, <hi>I had rather any Man ſhould do it than my ſelf; yet my ſelf, rather than none at all.</hi> The Argument may peradventure ſooner find ſome Maligners, than juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers. Wherein yet, as far as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and neceſſity of the Cauſe will ſuffer, I have ſo warily tempered the ſharpneſs of my Pen, that I hope none of moderate Humour himſelf, will juſtly charge me of being immoderate herein. But yet, if any where I ſhall ſeem otherwiſe, the diſcreet Reader will ſee it is out of the Inſtructions, Records, and Authors, whom
<pb facs="tcp:98319:5"/>
I follow, and not out of mine own Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who deſired as well herein, as in other of my Courſes, rather to imitate my Maſter in his mild and moderate Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, than willingly to be offenſive or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to any. Neither is it my purpoſe to have the Aſhes of the Dead raked up again. But as no Man can rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Commander, or skilful Pilot, without relating their paſt Exploits, and dangerous Storms: So neither could I, without wronging my Reader, and the principal Subject, commend him for ſo Worthy and Prudent a Governor, unleſs I had withal given a taſte of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ſtormy Time wherein he lived. And therefore I pray thee, Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, both charitabby and modeſtly to Cenſure my Travel and Pains herein.</p>

                     <hi>GOD knoweth how deſirous I have been, from time to time, to have my Doings approved by my ancient and honourable Friends. For which cauſe, ſince my coming to this Place, I have done nothing of importance againſt theſe Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without good Advice. I have riſen up early, and ſate up late, to yield Reaſons, and make anſwer to their Contentions and their Seditious Objections. And ſhall I now ſay, I have loſt my labour? Or ſhall my juſt dealing with diſobedient and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Perſons, cauſe my former profeſſed and ancient Friends, to hinder my juſt Proceedings, and make them ſpeak of my Doings, yea and of my Self, what they list?</hi>

Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> that an old Friend is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a new. <hi>I truſt thoſe that love me indeed will not ſo lightly caſt off their old Friends for any of theſe new fangled and Factious Sectaries, whoſe fruits are to make diviſion, and to ſeparate old, and aſſured Friends. In mine own private Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs I know I ſhall ſtand in need of Friends; but, in theſe publick Actions, I ſee no cauſe why I ſhould ſeek Friends, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they, to whom the care of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is committed, ought, of duty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to join with me. And if my honourable Friends ſhould for ſake me (eſpecially in ſo good a Cauſe) and not put their helping hand to the redreſs of theſe Enormities (being indeed a matter of State, and not of the leaſt moment) I ſhall think my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto this Place to have been for my puniſhment, and my hap very hard, that, when I think to deſerve beſt, and, in a manner, conſume my ſelf to ſatisfy that, which God, her Majeſty, and the Church, requireth of me, I ſhould be evilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</hi> Sed meliora ſpero. <hi>It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſome, that my deſire of Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by way of Subſcription, is for the better maintenance of my Book. They are mine Enemies that ſay ſo; but I truſt my Friends have a better opinion of me. Why
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98319:27"/>
ſhould I ſeek for any confirmation of my Book after twelve years approbation? or what ſhall I get thereby more than already I have? And yet, if Subſcription may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, it is confirmed long ago by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription almoſt of all the Clergy of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>before my time. Mine Enemies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and the ſlanderous Tongues of this uncharitable Sect, report that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, become a Papiſt, and I know not what. But it proceedeth from their lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not from any deſert of mine. I am further burthened with Wilfulneſs; I hope my Friends are better perſuaded of me, to whoſe Conſciences I appeal. It is ſtrange, that a man of my Place, dealing by ſo good warrant as I do, ſhould be ſo encountred, and, for not yielding, be counted wilful. But I muſt be content,</hi> Vincit qui patitur. <hi>There is a difference betwixt Wilfulneſs and Conſtancy. I have taken upon me, by the Place which I hold under her Majeſty, the defence of the Religion, and the Rites of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to appeaſe the Schiſms and Sects therein, to reduce all the Miniſters thereof to Uniformity, and to due obedience, and not to waver with every wind; which alſo my Place, my Perſon, my Duty, the Laws, her Majeſty, and the goodneſs of the Cauſe do require of me, and

wherein the Lords of her Highneſs's moſt Honourable Privy Council (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) ought in duty to aſſiſt and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance me. But how is it poſſible that I ſhould perform the Charge which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, after ſo long liberty, and lack of Diſcipline, if a few Perſons, ſo meanly qualified (as moſt of theſe Factions Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are) ſhould be countenanced againſt the whole State of the Clergy of greateſt account both for Learning, Years, Staidneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Religion, and Honeſty, and open Breakers and Impugners of the Law, young in Years, proud in Conceipt, contentious in Diſpoſition, ſhould be maintained againſt their Governors, ſeeking to reduce them to Order, and to Obedience?</hi> Haec ſunt initia Haereticorum, &amp; ortus, atque conatus Schiſmaticorum malè cogitantium, ut ſibi placeant, ut praepoſitum ſuperbo tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more contemnat.

Thus do men fall from the Church of God; thus
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98319:28"/>
is a foreign unhallowed Altar erected; and thus is Chriſt's Peace, and God's Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Unity rebelled againſt. For mine own part, I neither have done, nor do any thing in theſe Matters, which I do not think my ſelf in conſcience and duty bound to do, and which her Majeſty hath not with earneſt Charge committed unto me, and which I am not well able to juſtify to be moſt requiſite for this Church and State; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, next to her Majeſty (though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or at the leaſt moſt unhappy) the chief care is committed unto me, which I will not by the grace of God neglect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever come upon me therefore. Neither may I endure their notorious Contempts, unleſs I will become</hi> Aeſop'<hi>s Block, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do all that which hither to hath been done. And how then ſhall I be able to perform my Duty, according to her Majeſty's Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? It is certain, that if way be given unto them, upon their unjuſt Surmiſes and Clamours, it will be the cauſe of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which hereafter the State will be ſorry for. I neither care for the Honour of this Place I hold (which is</hi> Onus <hi>unto me) nor the largeneſs of the Revenue, neither any worldly thing (I thank God) in reſpect of doing my Duty; neither do I fear the diſpleaſure of Man, nor the evil

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98319:29"/>
me to think that God's Judgments are not far off. The day will come, when all mens hearts ſhall be opened. In the mean time I will depend upon him, who never faileth thoſe that put their truſt in him.</hi>

                  <p n="96">96. When he was Biſhop of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">When at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he treated the Recuſants mildly, and won many of them over.</note> and Vice-preſident of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> he did exceeding good by that his continual preaching, as alſo by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conference, and conventing of the Papiſts, whom he uſed with mild and temperate ſpeeches, and thereby got many of them to conform themſelves, both Gentlemen, and others, whereby, as at his firſt coming unto the See of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he found many Recuſants, ſo he left very few at his coming thence.</p>
                  <p n="97">97. Immediately after he came to be <note place="margin">When he came to be Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, he dealt with the Learnedſt of them by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical.</note> Archbiſhop, he convented before him the chiefeſt and moſt learned Recuſants throughout all <hi>England.</hi> He alſo wrote Letters to the Biſhops, his Brethren,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98319:50"/>
within the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to proceed with the Recuſants by their Authority Eccleſiaſtical, and Cenſures of the Church, and called yearly upon them for an account of their doings. He ſent forth alſo many Warrants, by vertue of her Highneſs's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and thereby had daily brought before him both Recuſants and Prieſts; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of their Offences were reſtrained, and proceeded againſt, or delivered over unto the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be dealt withal, as to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice appertained, after the Laws were enacted againſt Recuſants and Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="98">98. Thus this grave and prudent <note place="margin">He kept a ſtraight hand over the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prieſts and ſubtle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> Archbiſhop always carried a moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye, and ſtraight hand over the ſubtle-headed Papiſts; as fearing leſt they conceived an hope of advancing their Cauſe and Quarrel by help of the aforeſaid Contentions betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and theſe Sectaries; and ſo ſoon as they ſhould have found the Forces on both ſides ſufficiently weakned and enfeebled by a long continuance of the Conflict, to have deſtroyed the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed with the Vanquiſhers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98319:50"/>
to re eſtabliſh their Papal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuperſtitious Impieties; as not long after this Archbiſhop's death they attempted to do, by the diveliſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that damnable <hi>Powder-Treaſon;</hi> which if it had ſucceeded, their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then was, to have put both alike to the Sword.</p>
                  <p n="99">99. You may perceive by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, <note place="margin">He is unjuſtly traduced by the Sectaries.</note> how untruly ſome of the uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and precipitate Sectaries tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him for a Papiſt, and called him <hi>The Pope of</hi> Lambeth in their Libels, and Conventicles, and moſt unjuſtly reproached him with the Title of <hi>Doctor</hi> Pearn'<hi>s Servant,</hi> whom they likewiſe taxed with Popery, and falſly charged him to have infected the Archbiſhop therewith, becauſe of his affection and love unto him, for the reaſons ſpecified before. The truth is, as the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was of his own nature a very loving kind man, ſo he did hate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude <note place="margin">He hated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note> in any, and could never be taxed with that fault. He was likewiſe (as the Gentlemen of <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> had daily experience) very firm, <note place="margin">Is firm in his Friendſhips.</note> and marvailous conſtant, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and profeſſed love, which brought him in great diſpleaſure in the Cauſe of

the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> with whoſe Life, and Actions, though I have nothing to do (having only taken upon me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port another Man's) yet thus much I may truly ſay, that his misfortune drew upon the Archbiſhop the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, and ſevereſt reprehenſion <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cenſured for his affection to the Earl of</hi> Eſſex.</note> from her Majeſty, that he had ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undergone in all his life.</p>
                  <p n="100">100. For after that the Earl began to fall upon Courſes diſpleaſing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtful unto her Majeſty, nevertheleſs ſuch was the confidence the Archbiſhop had in the Earl's Loyaly, and his own ſtedfaſtneſs in that Friendſhip which he had formerly profeſſed unto him, that he could not be drawn from being a continual Interceſſor for him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with her Majeſty was ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, <note place="margin">The Queen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at his inter ceſſion for the Earl, which much grieves him.</note> and ſo ſharply rebuked him for the ſame, that the good old Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop came ſometimes home much grieved and perplexed.</p>

The next Morning he ſent a Gentleman to know

how the Queen did, and how ſhe reſted all night.

                  <p n="102">102.

                  <p n="103">103. Towards which time, though <note place="margin">

                     </note> by reaſon of her melancholy Diſeaſe, ſhe was impatient of others ſpeeches with her, yet was ſhe well pleaſed to hear the Archbiſhop, the then Biſhops of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and the now Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> with ſome other Divines, give her comfort and counſel to prepare her ſelf to God-ward, and moſt devoutly prayed with them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p n="104">104. NOW the much-lamented <note place="margin">The Faction take heart on the Queen's death.</note> death of this noble Queen gave great hope to the Factious of challenging forth with all exemption from the Cenſures, and ſubjection of Eccleſiaſtical Authority: But how vain their hopes were, the iſſue hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and although the Archbiſhop was much dejected and grieved for the loſs of his dear Sovereign and Miſtreſs, who had ſo highly advanced him, yet he, with the reſt of the Lords, repaired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and after two hours ſitting in Council about the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Proclamation, he principally (as his Place required) with a chearful countenance, and the reſt of the Lords in like ſort accompanying him, firſt at the Court-gate at <hi>White-hall,</hi> with the

                  <p n="105">105. I am doubtful to ſpeak (leſt I might ſeem to detract from others) of the great comfort which the common People and Citizens took in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Archbiſhop, and how hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily they prayed for him at his return, as if they nothing doubted, but that all went well for the State in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, among whom he was preſent.</p>
                  <p n="106">106. He was indeed beloved of all ſorts of People, yea even of ſome of them who were the moſt fervent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenders themſelves, as they have confeſſed ſince his death. And well worthy was he ſo to be, for that he carried a moſt mild and moderate hand over them. A more particular love alſo he deſerved of many, for his affection <note place="margin">Archbiſhop a lover and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of Liberal Arts.</note> unto liberal and ingenious Arts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his domeſtick government and care
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98319:53"/>
was no leſs argument than his publick; which I have formerly ſpoken of. For, beſides the pains which he took himſelf (after he was Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and Archbiſhop of. <hi>Canterbury)</hi> many years with a number of worthy young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, in reading unto them thrice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he took into his Houſe, beſides his Chaplains, divers of quality to inſtruct them in the Mathematicks, and other Lectures of ſundry Arts and Languages; giving them good allowance, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments <note place="margin">His Liberality great.</note> otherwiſe, as occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. And beſides the many poor Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <note place="margin">He kept many poor Scholars in his Houſe,</note> whom he kept in his Houſe till he could provide for them, and prefer them (as he did ſundry to good Eſtates) he alſo maintained divers in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity <note place="margin">And main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained divers in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities.</note> at his own charge, and gave liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them and others of any towardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he heard of their neceſſity, and wants.</p>
                  <p n="107">107. He kept likewiſe for the exerciſe of Military Diſcipline, a good Armory, <note place="margin">Is an incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Military Exerciſes.</note> and a fair Stable of great Horſes; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was able to arm at all points both Horſe and Foot, and divers times had One hundred Foot, and Fifty Horſe of his own Servants muſtered, and trained; for which purpoſe he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98319:54"/>
Captains. He had alſo skilful Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who taught them to manage their Horſes, and inſtructed them in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exerciſes, all whom he rewarded in liberal manner. By this means he had divers of his own Gentlemen that afterwards proved good Soldiers; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whereof became Captains and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and ſome for their Valour and Service were Knighted in the Field. There were alſo divers others, that for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Languages and Qualities, were fit to be employed by any Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. Inſomuch as his Houſe, for the Lectures and Scholaſtical Exerciſes therein performed, might juſtly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a little Academy, and in ſome <note place="margin">His Houſe a little Academy.</note> reſpects ſuperior, and more profitable; <hi>viz.</hi> for Martial Affairs, and the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that Divines and other Scholars had, being near, and often at the Court, and chief Seats of Juſtice, from whence they continually had the Paſſages and Intelligences both for Matters of State, and government in Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Civil.

And here I may not forget his religious care and provident order for the due execution of his Charge, and determination of all ſuch Cauſes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto his proper cognizance and place. To which end and purpoſe, he appointed every <hi>Thurſday</hi> in Term a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſet Commiſſion day; upon which he had a Sermon in his Chappel by one of his Houſhold Chaplains, and entertained the Commiſſioners, and their Attendants, though to his great expence, which he little eſteemed in regard of the well guiding, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affairs, then by him underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

Subjects came chearfully to the hearing of their Cauſes, and without fear of partiality in any particular Perſon. And howſoever the Cauſe went, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop could not be impeached of raſh or inconſiderate proceeding, ſeeing he had the conſent and approbation of all Profeſſions. For the Archbiſhop always gave Sentence, and ordered matters as the greater part of the Court did encline, beginning at the Junior firſt, although himſelf would ſometimes diſſent from them in opinion, and ſo he would tell them, but without tartneſs; yea in ſuch kind and loving manner, as no man was hindered in delivering his mind. By which means he was ſure always to have the Cauſe fully debated, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's opinion fully known; which when he found concurring with his own, and the Proceedings ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Juſtice, he would go on to ſentence and determine the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="110">110. Wherein he carried himſelf <note place="margin">His Reſolution in Judgment.</note> with great reſolution, and courage, were the Perſons never ſo great that were intereſted in the ſame, as you may perceive by one Inſtance (among many) when himſelf was yet no Counſellor of

A Gentleman of good Note ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">An Inſtance.</note> how the Court was enclined to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Cauſe (not according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) told the Archbiſhop, that upon another occaſion there grew ſome ſpeech of that Cauſe before the Lords of the Council, and their Lordſhips were of another opinion than his Grace, and the reſt of the Commiſſioners, ſeemed to be; what telleſt thou me (ſaid the Archbiſhop) of the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? I tell thee, they are in theſe Caſes to be adviſed by us, and not we by them. He would upon ſuch like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions oftentimes ſay unto his private Friends towards his latter time (when they talked familiarly with him, and obſerved his courage and ſtoutneſs) <hi>That two things did help much to make a man confident in good Cauſes, namely,</hi> Orbitas, &amp; Senectus; <hi>and (ſaid he) they ſteed me both.</hi>

                  <p n="113">113.

He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten feaſted the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of his Dioceſs and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> eſpecially, his Gates were always open, and his Hall ſet twice or thrice over with Strangers: Upon ſome chief Feſtival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days he was ſerved with great ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſometime upon the Knee, as well <note place="margin">His State.</note> for the upholding of the State that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto his Place, as for the better education and practice of his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Attendants in point of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>

                  <p n="115">115. Every third Year he went into <note place="margin">He was always honourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Gentlemen of the Country.</note>

                        <hi>The Biſhops have a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at</hi> Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note> 
                     <hi>London</hi>'s Houſe, to confer with ſome of the Biſhops and Judges of his Court, concerning the Affairs of the Church, which were then to be treated upon. As he was thus going in his Barge upon an extaordinary cold day, and having his Barge-cloath tied up (as his cuſtom was) to the top of the Bales, the Wind blew very ſharply; ſo that the young Gentlemen (ſhaking with cold) deſired to have the Cloath down, which he would by no means permit, becauſe the Water was rough, and he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee his way. By reaſon whereof the flaſhing of the Water, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air, did ſo pierce the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop (being above Threeſcore and <note place="margin">The Archbiſhop 73 years old, is ſeized with a cold on the Water.</note> thirteen years of Age) that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the ſame night of a great cold, which he had then taken in the mould of his Head.</p>
                  <p n="132">132. Notwithſtanding which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemperature, for performance of his accuſtomed duty unto the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98319:64"/>
(as formerly unto the Queen) he went upon the next Sabbath following (being the firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Lent)</hi> over unto the Court at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where <note place="margin">Goes to the Court, has ſpeech with the King about Affairs of the Church.</note> meeting the then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> they both had long ſpeech with his Highneſs about the Affairs of the Church, both before and after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's coming from the Chappel. For which cauſe, ſtaying long at the Court, and having faſted until it was near One one of the Clock, as he was going from his Majeſty unto the Council-chamber to dinner, he was taken with a dead <note place="margin">Is taken with the dead Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.</note> Palſey; whereby all his Right ſide was benummed, and he bereaved of his Speech. From the Council-chamber he was, by means of his deareſt Friends, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> with the aid of the King's Servants, carried to the Lord Treaſurer's Chamber, and afterwards in his Barge conveyed home <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Is conveyed to</hi> Lambeth.</note> to <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="133">133. His Majeſty (being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the report of his Sickneſs) came upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following to viſit <note place="margin">The King vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits him.</note> and comfort him with very kind and gracious Speeches; ſaying, <hi>That he would beg him of God in his Prayer:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98319:65"/>
Which if he could obtain, he ſhould think it one of the greateſt temporal Bleſſings that could be given him in this Kingdom.</hi> The Archbiſhop made offer to ſpeak to his Majeſty in <hi>Latin;</hi> but neither his Highneſs, nor any there preſent, well underſtood what he ſaid, ſave only, that by the laſt words, <hi>pro Eccleſia Dei,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">He earneſtly recommends the Church to his Royal Care.</note> 
                     <hi>pro Eccleſia Dei</hi> (which in earneſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with his Eyes and Hands lift up, he oftentimes iterated) his Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (as it pleaſed him afterwards to report) that he continued the Suit, which ſundry times before, and at his laſt attendance on his Highneſs, he had earneſtly recommended unto his Royal and Special Care in behalf of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="134">134. After his Majeſty's departure, the Archbiſhop had neither perfect uſe of his Speech, nor ability to write his mind; as he did deſire, by the ſigns that he uſed for Ink and Paper. Which being brought unto him, and he making offer to write, had no feeling of his Pen, for it fell out of his Hands. When he perceived his impotency to write, after two or three aſſays, he ſetched a great ſigh, and lay down again; and on <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> following (at Eight of the Clock
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98319:65"/>
at night) the laſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1603. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>He departs this Life,</hi> Feb. <hi>ult.</hi> 1603.</note> he quietly, and like a Lamb, died the Servant of Chriſt; as in the time of his Sickneſs, by many infallible ſigns, was manifeſt unto my ſelf, and thoſe that attended him in that time of his viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which cannot be better teſtified by any, than by Doctor <hi>Barlow,</hi> the now Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> together with Doctor <hi>Buckeridge</hi> (now Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter)</hi> and Doctor <hi>Charryor,</hi> his then Houſhold Chaplains; who for the moſt part, were continually with him, from the beginning of his Sickneſs, unto the end of the ſame. Of the manner of whoſe death, though ſome undiſcreet men have cenſured uncharitably, yet I may truly ſay, as <hi>Solon</hi> did for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ends of <hi>Eleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton,</hi> who in the abſence of their Mother's Oxen, did yoke themſelves, and drew her in her Coach to the Temple, and after their Sacrifices performed, went to bed, and were found the next Morning dead, without hurt or ſorrow: So fared it with this good Archbiſhop, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſiſtance of ſome, who by their Places ſhould have undergone with him the Charge of guiding and ſupporting of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, took the yoke
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98319:66"/>
and burden thereof himſelf for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church's ſake. And when he had performed his Oblations of Prayer and Thankſgiving to God; was carried to bed, and there died, without ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt or ſorrow. Thus he, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 8.</note> (of whom he was a true Son) <hi>yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the Spirit, and died in a good age, an old man, and of great years, and was gathered unto his people.</hi> He was Biſhop <note place="margin">

                  <p n="135">135. Now though he lived and died, no doubt, a choſen and beloved Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and one, who as a learned Man truly ſaith, <hi>had devoutly conſecrated both his whole life to God, and his painful labours to the Church;</hi> yet there wanted not ſome, who after his death fought by an infamous Libel to ſtain the glory of his ever honourable Name. But their Malice was ſoon diſcovered, and the Author, at leaſt the Publiſher, puniſhed by an honourable Sentence, given in the High Court of Star-chamber.</p>
                  <p n="136">136. And if what was then ſpoken by their Lordſhips, and the reſt of that great and judicious Court, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Archbiſhop's Piety, Wiſdom,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98319:66"/>
Learning, and Government, were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Print; he that would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to write any thing more of him, might juſtly have been condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of indiſcretion.

                  <p>DIVERS have hitherto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly reported of this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the Actors in it, according to their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Intelligences attained thereof, and to the Humours they are led by. And albeit the Matter (falling out not many Months ſince) might ſeem to be in freſh remembrance of many; yet ſundry there are which hitherto know not the very particular dangerous Attempts and Outrages, into which theſe men burſt out, and the moſt part (I think) have not heard what was the original cauſe of ſuch their diſcontentment, or the main drift and purpoſe of all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments, nor of any the ways and means by them uſed, for furthering and atchieving the principal ſcope they ſhot at, nor of any their Counſels and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Action, nor yet who were
<pb facs="tcp:98319:74"/>
their Complices that were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the matter, in ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or more ſpecial terms.</p>
                  <p>By want of knowledge of which things, ſundry perverſe and ſiniſter Conceits and Miſdeemings have ariſen, and are blown abroad amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which ſeem meet to be abated, and reformed in them.</p>
                  <p>For the Papiſt, our common Enemy, in ſome late Writings from beyond the Seas, hath (as I am informed) wreſted theſe mens dealings to another end. And ſundry at home, who would ſeem more moderate than many other of their own Judgment; yet in favour of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or (which I judge rather) upon liking of their Opinion in matter of Church-Government, have allowed their meanings to have been good, though they miſlike (ſomewhat they ſay) of the manner. Others ſeek to diſguiſe the very Purpoſes of theſe men, as if that which (in truth) was moſt, had been leaſt of all intended by them. There are ſome alſo, purpoſing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the Fault, and to prevent that ſo juſt a blot may not fall upon the meaneſt Favourer of pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, who will needs make them to
<pb facs="tcp:98319:74"/>
have been ſtark mad, and ſuch as knew not what they ſaid or did. And there want not certain alſo, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pity and commiſeration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, are ſaid not to ſpare to mutter abroad, that Matters are made worſe, and of greater conſequence and peril than they be in deed: And that theſe Men, with ſome others, were proſecuted with greater vehemency and ſharpneſs, than the Cauſe it ſelf, or quality of their ſeveral Offences might juſtly miniſter occaſion.</p>
                  <p>All which untrue Surmiſes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, what do they elſe but appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and directly tend unto the injury, depravation and ſlander of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Juſtice of this Realm and State? For aſſertion and clearing whereof from ſuch Calumniations, and to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt alſo the very truth of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto all that are deſirous to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed aright in them: It is thought meet that this Treatiſe (for good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations hitherto ſtayed ſince it was finiſhed) ſhould now at length be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
                  <p>Whereby I make no doubt, but it will appear to any that ſhall be pleaſed to peruſe it with a ſingle eye, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb facs="tcp:98319:75"/>
theſe Cauſes are to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked into, for the weight and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them; how honourable the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in them have been for manner; and how exceeding mild and merciful a courſe hath been holden by the State, not only with ſome of the chief Dealers, but alſo with ſundry others notable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents in the Action, who though they be ſufficiently well known, yet hitherto have not been ſo much as cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion; how far ſoever (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) they may ſeem unto ſome (not unwiſe) to have waded therein, or to have entertained intelligence of it, both dangerouſly and undutifully. So far is her Excellent Majeſty, and the whole State, from aggravating mens Offences, yea, and from taking advantage, even when moſt juſt occaſion (ſometimes) is offered.</p>
                  <p>I pray God this notable rare Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be hereafter anſwered (by thoſe who both in this and other matters ſtand not a little in need of it, how little ſoever they acknowledge it) with that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of dutiful remembrance and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which it worthily deſerveth at their hands.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE</head>
                  <p>WHEN in the time of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the truth of Religion, ſuch as pretend greateſt ſincerity and zeal, do fall into fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fancies and dangerous Attempts; Then ſome do thereupon ſtagger in the Doctrine, and are ſcandalized: Some be quite driven back; And others are carried even with open mouth to ſlander and to reproach the very profeſſion of the Goſpel. The two firſt of which are of the weaker, but the laſt are of the wickeder ſort. For theſe are ſtraightway ready to make compariſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Times, and to declaim largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſweet and golden quiet, with agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Judgment, which they (erroneouſly) conceive to have continually accompanied the Times of Superſtition and Blindneſs.</p>
                  <p>But though this were univerſally true, which is far otherwiſe; yet both the one ſort and the other, are dangerouſly deceived and tranſported into miſdeeming by want of due conſideration, what is the very well-ſpring and occaſion of ſuch Accidents under the profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98319:76"/>
For when <hi>Sathan,</hi> the deceiving Enemy of Mankind, had in the Times of <hi>Popery,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and as it were obſcure degrees (under a colour of Religion and Devotion) envenomed once the very Fountains of Doctrine with many peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Errors, much Superſtition, and groſs <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and had almoſt quite damned up the light of the glorious Goſpel; Then was it no marvel, though he here reſted his Labours, as being (in ſome ſort) arrived unto the main end of all his drifts and purpoſes. Inſomuch, as this once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, the reſt were ſufficiently able to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of themſelves. For upon corruption of Faith and Doctrine, muſt needs enſue either open cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Life and Converſation, or at leaſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, masked under a vail of Hypocriſy: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that walketh in darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth, and a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good fruit. Therefore after the victory got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he might more deeply deceive, and ſurely retain, whom he had caught, he thought it requiſite (at ſome ſeaſons) upon theſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to weave a vail of pretended unity, and as it were to candy and ſweeten them over with the lovely ſhew of peace and agreement: Which nevertheleſs being without verity, is nothing elſe but a lewd Conſpiracy, and is rather a deadly ſleep, wherewith men be overwhelmed, than an unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. For where all is ſubdued, what needs any further reſiſtance? And where a ſtrong man keeps the Houſe, all that he poſſeſſeth are in quiet, till a ſtronger than he do come to diſpoſſeſs him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98319:76"/>
But when as God taking compaſſion of his Church in the eyes of his mercy, had in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times made the day-ſtar to ſhine again in our hearts, no ſooner did the beams of his Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to glimpſe and break forth, but the old crafty Serpent (knowing his Kingdom to be invaded afreſh, and his time but ſhort) began in great wrath to rouſe up himſelf again, and to hammer over anew all his long-approved wicked Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to plant new Engines for the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and hinderance of the paſſage and propagation of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>This he plotteth (beſides many other means) by ſeducing ſome that profeſs it, into ſedition and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: And ſo in their Perſons he bringeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it ſelf into obloquy and hatred with ſuch as afore did think hardly of it, or were not perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it was the truth. For by reaſon of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Subſtance, corrupted with <hi>Diabolical</hi> Malice, and by long Experience, even of 5553 years continuance, he is now become <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>mille-artifex,</hi> his perfect Crafts-maſter in infinite Devices and Subtilties. So that he doth at ſundry times very manifoldly and variably ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and plot, not only ſeveral and divers, but ſometimes even contrary Opinions and Actions, one to another; howbeit all to one and the ſelf-ſame general end, <hi>of ſeducing Mankind.</hi> Therefore (amongſt his infinite Deceits for hinderance of the Goſpel, and of Man's Salvation by it) ſome whom he cannot pervert in Doctrine, he ſeeketh to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint in Life: Others whom he cannot ſo eaſily ſeduce in their Converſation, he oftentimes ſoweth his cockle and darnel of Superſtition, Schiſm, and
<pb facs="tcp:98319:77"/>
Hereſy in their hearts, and ſo perverteth them in judgment, and matter of Religion. Some, whom he cannot entangle by one ſin, he tempteth to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw by a ſin contrary unto it. Others whom he cannot ſnare by groſs and actual Sins, he gets ground of, by making them have over-great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their own ſuppoſed Vertues and Purity: So that they grow hereby both to a conceit and ſelf-love of themſelves, and alſo to contemn and condemn others with the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Oh God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are:</hi> Or as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaketh touching ſuch proud Hypocrites, <hi>Depart from me, for I am holier than thou.</hi> Others he draweth into error by miſtaking of the true quality or cauſe of things, as when, not being able to corrupt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine of the Church, he perſuadeth Preachers moſt to inſiſt upon matters of meer cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as if they were of eſpecial neceſſity, and procureth the outward Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to be obtruded and beat upon, for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Point of Doctrine. So that matters of the ſubſtance of Doctrine and Faith in deed, do either wholly ſlip by untaught, or elſe are ſo ſlightly and ignorantly ſlubbered over by ſuch Preachers, that the common Adverſary the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> is thereby ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardened, than convinced in his Opinions. Which practice may hereby appear to be the very ſubtilty of <hi>Sathan,</hi> for that ſuch do uſe far more earneſtneſs and diligence to plant and bring in that their <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> than they do for retaining of purity and ſoundneſs of Doctrine, and are leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed and vchement againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than they are againſt ſuch as impugn that Fancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98319:77"/>
Out of this Head ſprings alſo that Error of ſome, who do attribute all diſorder and perſonal faults of men about execution of Laws, unto the Laws themſelves, and unto the very Policy of the Church: Thereupon gathering with themſelves, that the Plot of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> (if it might come in place) will ſurely ſerve as a <hi>Mithridate,</hi> and a ſovereign Salve, to heal (with ſhort applying) all Diſeaſes and Sores both of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Certain be ſo bewitched (in like ſort) by a kind of admiration of that, which is (in it ſelf) moſt neceſſary, as that in the mean time they overſlip matters of no leſs importance in the Life of a Chriſtian, becauſe they think it ſufficient to be occupied only about the other.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it cometh, that ſundry do attribute ſo much to the hearing of the Word preached, that neither publick nor private reading of Scripture, Works of Charity, Praying, nor practice of that which is preached, is any whit almoſt regarded of them. Whereby they are always learning, but never come unto the knowledge of the truth, as if the very work wrought of hearing alone could make them good and perfect Chriſtians. So that where in old time there were certain Hereticks called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Religion in bare hearing of Sermons. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo there are, who are ſo whetted againſt the abuſe of things, that the <hi>Seducer</hi> hereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth opportunity to draw them to omit even the good and commendable uſe of them. Such are thoſe, that becauſe they will not ſeem to confirm
<pb facs="tcp:98319:78"/>
God's truth by human Teſtimony, do therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe all light and help of good Arts, and learned Interpreters, and inſtead of them, do in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons nothing elſe, but blaze out their own frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unſound Collections, trifling out the time (without order and method) by an heap of earneſt and reſonant, but undigeſted words, vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, <hi>Tautologies</hi> and <hi>Battologies,</hi> without any ſubſtance of matter, to the great abuſe of their Auditory, and of that excellent Work. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alſo are ſo afraid to fall into ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of days, commanded for abſtinence and avoiding of moſt nutritive Diet, that at ſuch times they do uſually moſt pamper their vile Fleſh, even with a purpoſed and ſetled contempt of good Laws, in that behalf provided. Neither will this kind of Perſons (for the moſt part) uſe any private faſting, for ſubduing the Body, but muſt have a whole ſide of a Country, or a whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at leaſt, know when they faſt, and will not ſtick to ride out a dozen or twenty Miles from home to faſt with others for company (though without publick Authority) there to make oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great humbling themſelves, by abſtaining perhaps from one Meal, how plentifully and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately ſoever they do fare at Suppers, or at their next Meal. Likewiſe, to avoid opinion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious worſhip of the outward Elements at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſundry do refuſe to kneel at the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: And of the contrary ſide do fall to a prophane and ſwiniſh (at leaſt outward) irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that high and excellent Myſtery.

All theſe, and ſuch like, are uſual practices and ſleights of <hi>Sathan,</hi> whereby even in the time of the Goſpel, he cunningly inveigleth and ſlily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trappeth many, to the danger of themſelves, to the ſcandal and down-fall of others, and to the obloquy of true Religion. <hi>It is neceſſary</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that offences come; yet woe be to them, by whom they come.</hi> And <hi>there muſt needs be hereſies,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) that ſuch as be approved, may be made manifeſt.</hi> But of all the other, the laſt ſort of them (being ſuggeſted by <hi>Sathan,</hi> under the vizard of Vertue, Godlineſs, and Religion) are moſt pernicious and deviliſh: And the poiſon of them ſpreadeth and rankleth furtheſt, to the diſturbance and peril both of Church and Common-wealth, becauſe hereby the <hi>Devil</hi> transformeth himſelf into an <hi>Angel</hi> of light. For as the moſt noble Creature engendred, is moſt loathſome and baſe in his corruption: So is the untrue pretence and colour of Piety and Religion (things of themſelves of chiefeſt price and excellency) the moſt dangerous ſnare, and deadly dart, that <hi>Sathan</hi> can ſhoot forth.

                     </note> his intolerable Inſolences and Contempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Laws, and the Peace of the Church, was both deprived of chat his Benefice, and depoſed from his Miniſtry by Authority of

                  <p>This <hi>Hacket</hi> had dwelt alſo by a long ſpace in <hi>Oundel,</hi> where firſt he ſerved one Maſter <hi>Huſſey</hi> an Eſquire, by the ſpace of ten Years; and after, for ſome time, he ſerved Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Treſham,</hi> Knight: He was a notable bragging and quarelſome Fellow, yet thought in truth to be but a very recreant Daſtard.</p>
                  <p>He long together uſed one lewd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly practice, which was to reſort unto <note place="margin">He frequently reſorted to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to mock and carp at them.</note> Sermons (of purpoſe) to gibe, mock, and carp at them: And having a good Memory (which was the only commendable part in him) he uſed in ſcoffing manner to preach over again in Alehouſes the Sermons that he had heard, moſt inſiſting and ſporting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others at ſuch Paſſages thereof which pleaſed him leaſt, or whereat he imagined any likely matter of deriding might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>

But he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſe and licentious Company, and an idle courſe of life, without labour or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry either to get or ſave, lewdly and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly miſpent and waſted in ſhort ſpace all her Goods.</p>

It fell ſo out, that at length he pretended <note place="margin">

But moſt gladly, and with greateſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98319:83"/>
felicity that might be, he uſed to ſpend his mouth largely in Invectives, Railings and Contumelies againſt Biſhops and other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church, and alſo againſt the Laws, Orders, and whole Government Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, not ſticking (as was probably ſuſpected) to procure alſo ſundry lewd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Libels againſt them and other Preachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be framed and ſet up thereabouts.</p>

But whenſoever this devout <note place="margin">Slighted the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> Flock came ſo near to <hi>Stoke Church,</hi> as they might perceive the Miniſter to be yet at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service and Prayer; then they uſed to ſtay abroad and reſt themſelves in the Green Churchyard there (without going into the Church) until they heard the Pſalm begun before Sermon, for fear leſt they ſhould be polluted by thoſe Prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98319:83"/>
One moſt memorable Prank (above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) was plaid in <hi>Oundel</hi> by <hi>Hacket,</hi> which is renowned far and near for the unmanly brutiſhneſs of it. It happened that M. <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> his Maſter fell at debate, and was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one <hi>Freckingham</hi> an Artificer of the Town. This <hi>Freckingham</hi> had a Son which was a Schoolmaſter, who (as in nature he was bound) did take part with his Father. Now <hi>Hacket</hi> meeting this Schoolmaſter in an Alehouſe or Inn, did lovingly (as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſignify unto him how ſorry he was, that there ſhould be any breach betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and him the ſaid Schoolmaſter, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him (that ſuſpected no Treachery) with ſuch good Speeches, till ſpying an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he ſo graſped both <hi>Freckingham</hi> his Arms, as that he might eaſily hold him, and throw him to the ground. Thus having gotten him down on the ground under him, <note place="margin">He treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly bit off a man's Noſe in a Quarrel.</note> 
                     <hi>Hacket</hi> moſt ſavagely and curriſhly bit off the poor Schoolmaſter's Noſe with his teeth, which when he had ſo barbarouſly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both the ſaid <hi>Freckingham</hi> and one <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (a cunning Surgeon) inſtantly deſired the Noſe of him again, that whilſt the Wound was freſh and green, it might be ſtitched on and grow again (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it would) to avoid ſo foul and great deformity: But the <hi>Canibal</hi> Varlet not only utterly refuſed ſo to part with it, but held it up triumphantly, and ſhewed it with great vauntery and glory, to all that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it; and after (as ſome have reported)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98319:84"/>
did in a moſt ſpiteful and diveliſh outrage eat it up.</p>
                  <p>In proceſs of time it happened that his Maſter fell out with him, and put him from his Service (I think for no good Conditions) yet it is ſaid that he was retained afterward <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Retain'd in the Service of Sir</hi> Charles Morriſon.</note> in ſervice (by what means I know not) with a very worſhipful Gentleman, Sir <hi>Charles Morriſon,</hi> Knight, Nephew to his firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and one of thoſe againſt whom he lately cauſed his two ſmall Prophets ſo vilely to exclaim, and ſo unworthily to charge, even openly in <hi>Cheatſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides his former Vertues and good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <note place="margin">Hacket <hi>a great Swearer and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in his Youth.</hi>
                     </note> this <hi>Hacket</hi> was alſo a very great Swearer and Blaſphemer of the Name of God in his younger years; which courſe, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to retain the reputation of a Profeſſor of the Goſpel (whereof he made great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) he was forced to leave, he turned his ſingle Oaths (in truth) into worſe and more horrible, joined with moſt fearful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations <note place="margin">Which after his pretended Converſion he turn'd into areadful Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations.</note> againſt himſelf, whenſoever he would make any Aſſeverations, wherein he deſired to be credited, as namely theſe: <hi>So God judge me, I renounce God,</hi> and <hi>God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> and <hi>damn me,</hi> or do ſo, or ſo unto me, if this be not true: which was ſo uſual, and by long cuſtom ſo inveterate in him, even till the time of his apprehenſion, that in the midſt of his counterfeit Holineſs (whereby he ſeduced <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton)</hi> he often burſt forth into this kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration againſt himſelf, as an eſpecial motive
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98319:84"/>
(amongſt others) to have his words to be better believed by them. <hi>Arthington</hi> noted this courſe of <hi>Hacket</hi>'s as a notable vertue in him, and a matter of rare zeal. <hi>His manner</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of praying is as it were ſpeaking to</hi>

He prayed ſo confidently for Miſtreſs</hi> H. <hi>that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God to have given her unto him, to reſtore her to her former health and liberty every way, ſaying, Lord, according to thy promiſe thou haſt power, and I have faith, therefore it ſhall come to paſs.</hi> This Miſtreſs <hi>H.</hi> is a Gentlewoman of <hi>London,</hi> who pretendeth or feareth to be poſſeſſed with a Devil now fourteen years together.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe he was given to quaffing and <note place="margin">Addicted to Drunkenneſs and laſcivious Life.</note> drunkenneſs: Being not only a Maltſter, but a Malt-worm, and was addicted alſo to laſcivious life with Women, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanieth the other vicious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: For credit whereof his own Story or Legend (which himſelf endited as a notbale Monument of his excellent Vertues and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Holineſs) may give too ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: For therein he telleth of many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations in this kind with Women, which (as himſelf confeſſeth) he rejected not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but went further than either godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or yet civil honeſty would permit. But he pretendeth that theſe Baits were offered and laid by his Enemies (who ſought matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him) as Snares and Traps whereby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98319:85"/>
to take his holineſs tardy, that belike was ſo hard to be entangled. Inſomuch as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> in the forefront of that Hiſtory (which he did whilſt he was yet ſeduced by <hi>Hacket)</hi> doth ſtamp this brand and cenſure upon it, That they were prophane Speeches and matters of Women, which he would not have ſet down, but that he could not otherwiſe reveal the villanous practice which <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Enemies intended for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he moſt childiſhly and ridiculouſly excuſed then the matter. For further proof and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his laſcivious Diſpoſition, it is alſo informed from the Place of his Abode, that on a time (under colour of giving godly Counſel) he attempted to have wickedly raviſhed a poor man's Daughter, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was forced to ſtep aſide out of the way for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Neither did the wickedneſs of this Wretch here reſt it ſelf: For he was vehemently holden in ſuſpicion for committing alſo of ſundry Robberies.</p>
                  <p>But that which maketh up the heap of <note place="margin">Covers his Wickedneſs with Profeſſion of Religion, and zeal for Reformation.</note> all Wickedneſs, is this: That the ſink of theſe Sins in him he always ſmoothly cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and parieted over (eſpecially for ſundry late years) with a very rare outward ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs in profeſſion of true Religion, and with a moſt entire (yea burning) deſire of reforming (forſooth) the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by eſtabliſhing the <hi>Presbyterial Diſcipline,</hi> which he did imagine would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98319:85"/>
prove like the Box of <hi>Pandora,</hi> for it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth cure for all Maladies and Diſorders.</p>
                  <p>But this his zeal and deſire of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Which he then chiefly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to after he had waſted his Subſtance.</note> begun then moſt of all to enkindle it ſelf in him, and to break forth, after that (by riotous miſpending and licentious life) he had waſted the Wealth that he had with the Widow, whom he married, whoſe hap was very hard to match with him, albeit he made more of her than ſhe deſired, for he made the uttermoſt peny. For then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun <note place="margin">He pretended to a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit, and to miraculous Works, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to erecting the Diſcipline.</note> with counterfeit Holineſs to ſet out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (amongſt ſuch of the ſimpler ſort as had zeal without knowledge) to be a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an extraordinary and ſingular Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſuch as (in old time) the Prophets and Holy Men of God were; making ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as if he had ſome peculiar Gifts and Qualities, to be able even to tell Secrets and work Miracles, which many believed; whereof ſome did attribute them to Sorcery and Enchantments, but the ſimpler ſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his rare Spirit and Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>For he truſted by this perſuaſion to get ſuch credit with the unſtable Multitude, as that by their hands he might one day be able (whoſoever ſhould withſtand it) to bring his Purpoſes about, for erecting of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> to his own great eſtimation and advancement. In this vain and ſeducing Humour he is reported (I know not how truly) to have travelled in the North parts unto <hi>York:</hi> For among the ſimpler People (where he was not known) he hoped by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98319:86"/>
Vizard of Holineſs and Religion not a little to prevail in ſetting forward his Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For which purpoſe he took upon him there the Office and Spirit of St. <hi>John</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Affirmed at</hi> York <hi>to have the Office and Spirit of</hi> John Baptiſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> affirming, that he was ſent thither by God to prepare the way of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſecond coming to judgment. But the counterfeit holineſs and lewd ſeducing purpoſe of the Varlet being diſcovered unto ſome in Authority, he was welcomed not with loſs of his Head (as that holy man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly was, whom he wickedly counterfeited) <note place="margin">Being detected he was whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the City.</note> but was well whipped and after baniſhed that City.</p>
                  <p>This Medicine wrought not ſo effectually with him, as that it could terrify him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the like Attempts. For it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that after this he aſſayed again to put on the like Perſon or Mask at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> where <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Had the ſame uſage after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln.</note> he alſo found the ſame Cheer and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment for his pains, as he received afore at <hi>York.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this erroneous Opinion (whereby through ſelf-love and illuſion of the Devil, he thought that he was reſerved of God for <note place="margin">Fancied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſerv'd of God for ſome great Work.</note> ſome great and excellent Work, being blown forward by the ſhew of zeal, and of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs for ſuch a Reformation) could not thus eaſily be quenched and rooted out of him: the rather, for that by uſe and imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as he moſt followed and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with (though wholly otherwiſe he were unlettered) he had grown to ſuch a dexterity in conceiving of Extemporal Prayers, with

                  <p>At one of the times that he was brought in queſtion for his Seditious, and indeed Treaſonable Speeches, it happened that he was convented before that honourable Counſeller Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him (for more ſafegard) to be watched the night before he was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Northampton</hi> Gaol, at what time the counterfeit diſſembling Wretch willed <note place="margin">Put into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> Gaol.</note> his Wife to let him lie alone in the Chamber that was to be watched, for that he had to confer with one that would come unto him that night: Inſinuating unto her, as if he were to have at that time ſome ſpecial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with God, or ſome Angel.

to her Majeſty, and to tell her plainly, that the Lord's pleaſure was, that ſhe muſt (with all ſpeed) reform her ſelf, her Family, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the Church: And that the Lord had further told him, by what means all the ſame ſhould be done; but that Secret he would not then deliver unto</hi> Hacket. <hi>Then</hi> Coppinger <hi>alſo prayed into God, deſiring him, if he would be with him, and bleſs that Buſineſs (which he had committed to his charge) that then he would both furniſh him with Gifts fit for ſo weighty an Action, and knit the heart of</hi> Hacket <hi>and his ſo together, as</hi> David'<hi>s and</hi> Jonathan'<hi>s,</hi> Moſes'<hi>s and</hi> Aaron'<hi>s: For anſwer hereof,</hi> Hacket <hi>took fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time till the morning, at which time in the morning (a Prayer being firſt made)</hi> Hacket <hi>laid all the Lord's buſineſs (which was to be done by himſelf) upon</hi> Coppinger'<hi>s back; telling him the Lord had appointed him to it, and would ſtand with him in it.</hi> Thus far in this Point goeth that Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <p>Now it had been inconvenient that <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi>

Upon which, he had thought to have returned preſently back, and to have left his intended Journey: But going on, and after being returned back, he imparted to his former Faſt-fellows the work of God in him, and deſired they might again join in the like, (which he (with ſome other) went forward with, to their comfort, but without their chief Guide, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to join.

Hereupon he obtained this Preacher's conſent to join with him, and about four others, on the Dord's-Day, in a Faſt: Which Day was choſen, that they might not binder their worldly Affairs in the Week; and that they uſed means to have notice given to ſome of the Preachers in Priſon of the Day of their humiliation, deſiring them to commend to God in their Prayers the holy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, which any fearing God, ſhould (in time)</hi>

The Night following</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>he thought (in his ſleep) that he was carried into Heaven; and there being wonderfully aſtoniſhed with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, and brightneſs of his glory, he made a loud, and moſt ſtrange noiſe, whereby he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his Brother that lay with him, and ſome in the next Chamber.

From you I received this Meſſage, That I ſhould attempt nothing but by advice of thoſe whom you would procure to counſel me: This was done from you in the name of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and therefore I obey it with great care and conſcience, expecting at your hands, that</hi> Monday, <hi>being the day appointed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that it may hold; that I may be juſtified in my courſe, or condemned.

God help us: I ſee Wiſdom, Zeal, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Love are ſeen but in few, and thoſe who would gladly uſe thoſe Graces and Gifts which God hath given them, cannot: But God ſeeth what is beſt to be done, and he will by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects bring to paſs whatſoever pleaſeth him. If you will anſwer my laſt Queſtions, there may much uſe be made of them. I deſire them as much in regard of others, as my ſelf, who are

reſolved of divers things, whereof I crave to be reſolved, which I do to good purpoſe. And as you commanded me (in the name of God) to be wiſe and circumſpect, and to deal by counſel, ſo, (as I may) I command you in the name of God, that you adviſe the Preachers to deal ſpeedily and circumſpectly, leſt ſome blood of the Saints be</hi>

                     <hi>Good Sir, and my loving Brother in the Lord, though ſuch as are admitted to conſult with God, and have by prayer and meditation much fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and acquaintance with his holy Majeſty, need not doubt of good ſucceſs in all things which he ſetteth them a work in, (though</hi> Satan <hi>and his Vaſſals croſs their courſe, and hinder their labour by all the means they can) yet is it alſo neceſſary that while we remain in the fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Saints, that we communicate one with another, that as loving Children we may all join together, to help each other, to be doers of our heavenly Father's will here on Earth, as the Angels do it in the Heavens. The conſcience which I had hereof, enforced me to write unto you lately, and the like moved you to ſpeak with me upon that Letter. And truly I did obſerve many things (in that little time we ſpent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) were ſaid and done, which might move either of us to praiſe our good God, and to cheer us up, to further ſo holy an Action as now is in</hi>

                     <hi>hand, which muſt needs ſpeed well in the end, becauſe it is the Lord's own work. And if we adventure our ſelves to do him ſervice here, he will reward elſewhere. You may be bold, for you have the warrant of the Word, the allowance of the State, and you walk in your own Calling: But I am to be fearful and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, becauſe the Dangers I enter into be infinite, my Courſe miſliked (though unknown) becauſe it is extraordinary; which Callings be ceaſed in all mens opinion of judgment, and have not (of long time) been heard of, or to be hoped for, but where the Word is not preached at all, or the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98319:96"/>
Church in a great waſte, which no body dare affirm our Church of</hi> England <hi>to be. Wherefore it ſeemeth that every ſtep that I ſhall make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſhall be upon thorns, and therefore I am to fear pricking: Yet for all this I am not without hope, neither is the ſame grounded but by good warrant. The end why I write unto you, is this, to intreat you to give thanks to thoſe holy men all on my behalf, who are now in queſtion. I have reaped much benefit from them, by their carriage towards me, though they know it not: For I durſt not (in regard of danger which might grow</hi>

                     <hi>to them) viſit any of them, ſince I found my ſelf carried with a zeal to do ſomewhat in the ſame Cauſe, for which they ſuffer. If by ſome effects hereafter I may ſhew it, that is it which I deſire to do, and in the mean time do what I can to perſuade the Saints, that in this Action I ſeek God's glory, and not mine own. I have been heretofore put back and diſſuaded from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing (leſt I marred all) by the wiſeſt, the learnedeſt, the zealouſeſt and holieſt Preachers of this City, gene Cauſes and weighty Reaſons moving thereunto. But yet this will not make me leave it, but ſtill I am enforced (by little and little) to labour to make my ſelf fit to take upon me the managing of it. Wherefore, if it pleaſe you to ſhew the other Letter and this, and beſeech them from me to lay them before the Lord, when they ſhall meet and join together in prayer: And if the Lord's Spirit ſhall aſſure their Spirits, that he hath been, is, and will be with me in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (how hard ſoever it ſeemeth to be) let me by their means be vouchſafed this favour, that I may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98319:96"/>
be allowed conference with the Preachers of the City: which Sute I make not for that I would ſeek to have approbation from them, or any other living Creature, but from God himſelf: Or that I purpoſe to do that which heretofore I have been adviſed unto; namely, acquaint them with the Courſes (which I purpoſe by God's aſſiſtance to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>take in hand) whereby great danger might grow to them, and little good to me: But that my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards them, may witneſs unto them the humility of my mind, and lowlineſs of my ſpirit, and care and conſcience not to enter into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without offer to have my Gifts examined; and if they ſhall be ſuppoſed to be ſuch as the Church may have uſe of, then let all holy means be uſed, which ſhall be adviſed to be fit to be done in ſuch a dangerous time, and weighty Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So beſeeching God to govern us in all our ways, and preſerve us in all our dangers, and ſupply us with whatſoever we ſtand in need of, I humbly and heartily commend you to God, this 21ſt day of</hi> May, 1591.</p>

Thereby making choiſe rather that <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſhould venture to put it in practiſe (if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained reſolute herein, which they found by him) of what dangerous conſequence ſoever ſuch a way might be, than that they, by bewraying of him to Authority, ſhould be any means to break off and prevent his Reſolution, or quench his Zeal.

                     <hi>Trinity</hi> Term laſt, was returned to <hi>London, Coppinger</hi> (hearing thereof) came to his Lodging, and then (with many words) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and magnified <hi>Hacket</hi> unto him, for the holieſt man that ever was, <hi>Chriſt</hi> only excepted, and one that travelled (together
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98319:100"/>
with him) for the good of the <hi>Queen</hi> and the Land, but after an <hi>extraordinary</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not both by one means. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <note place="margin">Arthington ſeems not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of their Secrets. <hi>Coppinger</hi> perſuades him to hear <hi>Hacket</hi>'s <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> Prayers, which he admires as divine, and eſteems him as a moſt holy man.</note> 
                     <hi>Arthington</hi> (as now he ſaith) deſired them to keep their Secrets to themſelves, and not to trouble him with them, (who had other buſineſs to attend;) yet <hi>Coppinger</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned him ſo, as he could not avoid, but yield to hear <hi>Hacket</hi> pray before them (as a man of a ſingular Spirit, albeit utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned of the Book.) The firſt Prayer of his (that <hi>Arthington</hi> heard) was about four or five Weeks before their apprehenſion. All which Prayers conceived by <hi>Hacket</hi> (even ſince his apprehenſion) the ſaid <hi>Arthington</hi> praiſed to be ſo divine, ſweet and heavenly, that thereby he was drawn into a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him. In all the Prayers that <hi>Hacket</hi> made in his preſence, <hi>Arthington</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this difference from other mens: That he uſually therein <hi>deſired the Lord to confound</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A horrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration uſed in his Prayer.</note> 
                     <hi>him, if he did not ſeek only his honour and glory in all things:</hi> Which <hi>Arthington</hi> marking from time to time in him, and ſeeing him ſtill to be ſo perfectly ſound and very well, was thereby drawn (together with <hi>Coppinger</hi>'s words and experience of him) to reckon and eſteem of him, as of a moſt holy man.</p>
                  <p>This Leſſon of wiſhing themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, his ſaid two Scholars (by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) did ſo perfectly learn of him, that to the great aſtoniſhment and horror of ſuch <note place="margin">The ſame uſed by the other two in their Affirmations.</note> (that afterward examined them) they uſed this Execration: <hi>Wiſhing themſelves confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98319:101"/>
and damned, if they ſaid not the truth,</hi> in every matter whereof they made any aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and wherein they deſired to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, thinking (as <hi>Arthington</hi> confeſſeth) that whatſoever the Spirit (as he fanſied) told him was a truth, he was bound to bind it upon his Salvation or Damnation. Theſe being joined with the Relation of certain extreme Torments, which <hi>Hacket</hi> had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">Hacket <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſuffer extream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward torments from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as well as outward from men, for trail of the truth of the Goſpel, which they conclude he is to eſtabliſh in all Kingdoms, and that all Scepters are to be yielded to him.</hi>
                     </note> unto them that he ſuffered, not only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the inſtigation of certain noble and worſhipful Perſons (as he untruly made them believe) but more grievouſly a great deal (he ſaid) by ſuffering whatſoever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Devils in Hell, Sorcerers or Witches in Earth, could practiſe againſt him (all which he pretended to have endured for trial and proof, that the Goſpel was the true Religion againſt Popery, and all other Sects) did ſo deeply aſtoniſh, or rather infatuate them; that (after great faſting and prayer uſed, which faſting they uſually performed on the Sabboth days) they all did reſolutely conclude, That if <hi>Hacket</hi> indured in truth all theſe torments and practices againſt him, for ſo holy an end, no doubt he was a man, which ſhould not only eſtabliſh the Goſpel in all Kingdoms, but all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould alſo yield their Scepters unto him, and he ſhould be eſtabliſhed chief King over all <hi>Europe.</hi> Reaſoning thus with themſelves, that ſurely the Lord had ſome great good to be done by him that had indured ſo much for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98319:101"/>
Now, this was the Opinion, which to <note place="margin">This was the main drift of <hi>Hacket</hi>'s cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and it ſucceeded.</note> have firmly planted in them two (as indeed it was firſt in <hi>Coppinger,</hi> and afterward in <hi>Arthington)</hi> was the main ſcope and drift (as may ſeem) of all <hi>Hacket</hi>'s cunning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting of ſo much Holineſs, Piety, Zeal and Religion.</p>
                  <p>To work this, he handled his Actions ſo <note place="margin">Coppinger <hi>avouched that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Hacket <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                     </note> warily with them, that <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſeriouſly once avouched unto <hi>Arthington,</hi> how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had by good experience found, that God would deny unto <hi>Hacket</hi> nothing which he prayed for or deſired, and namely proteſted, that <hi>Hacket</hi> begged of God in a Drought (that was not long afore their apprehenſion) a Shower of Rain, and that it was preſently ſent in good abundance; <hi>Coppinger</hi> alſo ſo firmly believed <hi>Hacket,</hi> that he told his own Man <hi>Emerſon,</hi> how <hi>Hacket</hi> being impriſoned, the Bolts would (often) fall off his heels miraculouſly.</p>
                  <p>But for proof that ſuch incredible Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were indeed ſuffered by <hi>Hacket,</hi> he appealed herein to ſome of the Nobility, and to divers others both of worſhip and good credit. This did <hi>Coppinger</hi> further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <note place="margin">Coppinger <hi>and</hi> Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>atteſt to the truth of</hi> Hacket'<hi>s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note> unto <hi>Arthington,</hi> ſaying, that Maſter <hi>Wigginton</hi> alſo did juſtify the truth of the Torments that <hi>Hacket</hi> ſuffered, and could do it with a hundred honeſt Witneſſes more, if need required. And <hi>Arthington</hi> himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo once heard <hi>Wigginton</hi> pitifully tell, how great and extreme Torments <hi>Hacket</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98319:102"/>
But being asked by them, why he was ſo tormented, and how theſe could tend to prove the Goſpel to be the only true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? <hi>Hacket</hi> anſwered them thus: That his Tormentors (the better to colour their lewd purpoſes and malice) gave out and ſurmiſed him to be out of his wits, but the truth was (ſaid he) that being once at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with one <hi>G. H.</hi> an obſtinate Papiſt, and reaſoning which was the true Religion (I <note place="margin">Hacket'<hi>s ſtrange way to prove the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion againſt Popery,</hi> &amp;c.</note> defending this which we now profeſs to be the truth, againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and all other Sects) amongſt other Speeches, I proteſted upon my Damnation, that this was the truth, and withal prayed, that I might ſink preſently down into Hell, if it was not ſo: And that, if he the ſaid <hi>G. H.</hi> would ſay ſo much for his Religion, if he did not ſink preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, then would I take <hi>Popery</hi> to be the true Religion. But he refuſing ſo to do, and being greatly moved thereby againſt me, complotted with a Knight (a neer Kinſman of his) and with another Gentleman (being a Papiſt) and with ſundry others, who found ſuch means, as that they procured Devils to be raiſed, Sorcerers, Witches and Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (all which (ſaid he) I know and can name, and mind one day, to help to burn them) to work upon my Body, with intent to make me call back my ſaid words of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, concerning the truth of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which if I would not do (ſaid they) but could endure the Torments that they would inflict, then they all would be of my

Religion, and would make me <hi>Emperor</hi> over all <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>This Tale to them that had minds afore <note place="margin">His Tale cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.</note> prepared, and took <hi>Hacket</hi> by reaſon of his moſt earneſt Proteſtations, Prayers, ſhew of zeal pretended, favour with God, and ſuch like, to be a man that would not tel an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth for all the world, ſeemed no way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, or to be diſcredited: So that theſe three principal Actors having as well among themſelves, as with others, often conferred hereabouts (both by word and writing) were by the midſt of <hi>Trinity</hi> Term become moſt reſolute, for the advancing of their deſignments.

But by what warrant I have done this, that is all: For if the Holy Ghoſt have been my Warrant, and carrieth me into ſuch Actions, as are differing from others of great note in the Church of God, what fleſh and blood dare ſpeak againſt me? This is it that 1 deſire at your hands, and at all the reſt of God's Servants, that you forbear to cenſure me and ſuch others, as ſhall deal extraordinarily with me in the Lord's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs committed to our charge, and judge of us by the effects that follow; which if you hereafter ſee to be wonderful great, then are all ordinary men (placed in Callings within this Land) to fear, and to call themſelves to examination before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice Seat of God, and ſee whether they have walked faithfully before God and man, in ſeeking the ſalvation of the Souls of the People, and the advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Antichriſt's.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98319:103"/>
the Church cannot be denied to be great, ſo that there is place for extraordinary men (though tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing Chriſtians will not admit this) therefore God's mercies ſhall appear to be wonderful great, if amongſt us he have raiſed up ſuch, as I know he hath, and hereafter I doubt not (by God's grace) but I, with the help of the reſt, ſhall be able to avow againſt all gainſayers whatſoever. My deſire heretofore hath been to have counſel and direction from others: But now (by comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table experience) I find that the Action (which the Lord hath drawn me into) is his own, and he will direct it himſelf by the Holy Ghoſt, and have the full honour of it, and therefore I wait upon him, and yet moſt heartily crave the Prayers of the Saints, that they will beſeech God to bleſs all his Servants, that he hath ſet awork in his own buſineſs.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98319:104"/>
they would willingly thruſt themſelves upon the Rocks of the Land, and Waves of the Sea. This I took to be ſpoken principally to my ſelf; and therefore I thought good to advertiſe you, that he ſpake the truth in thoſe words; but he touched not me, but himſelf, and the reſt of the Miniſters of the Land, who have not only run deſperately themſelves upon the Rocks and Waves, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the whole Ship, whereby they all be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Shipwreck, and ſhould have periſhed, if the Lord had not immediately called three of his Servants to help to recover it, who are not only ſent from God to his Church here, but alſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, through the World. My Calling is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to deal with Magiſtrates. Another hath to do with Miniſters, who hath written a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you of the City, but it cannot be delivered hardly this day. The other third is the chiefeſt</hi>

                  <p>For firſt having conceived mortal hatred againſt two great and worthy <hi>Counſellors</hi> of this Eſtate (who they thought would not a little ſtop the courſe they had taken, and

                     <hi>Coppinger</hi> had raced out both <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Name, and the Name of <hi>Oundell</hi> from whence it came) as a Man able and willing to do her Majeſty ſome principal ſervice, to offer their attendances to come before her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and to urge the delivery of the Letters, for that the matter (he ſaid) admitted no delays. The Letter from <hi>Hacket</hi> is nothing but an inciting and animating of <hi>Coppinger</hi> to perform the Lord's buſineſs (he had in hand) by many holy and devout words and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Alluſions to certain Stories of the Scripture. <hi>Coppinger</hi>'s Letter to her <hi>Majeſty</hi>

But the ſaid honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſonage ſent <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Letter again unto <hi>Coppinger,</hi> as of no moment for that purpoſe, and ſtayed the delivery of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> till ſome particular intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence might be had, to be firſt delivered to her Highneſs. The ſame day <hi>Coppinger</hi> alſo writ two ſeveral Letters to the ſame two Lords, in whoſe preſence he and <hi>Hacket</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to come before her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their Intelligence; this he did to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe them hereof aforehand. That which is written to the one of them, mentioneth a Supplication which <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſent (the day

                     </note> from the Lady afore-mentioned, craving ſome Particulars of that which they meant to diſcover, <hi>Coppinger</hi> writ to <hi>Hacket</hi> (being in <hi>London)</hi> to urge him unto ſome more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial point of Intelligence: Whereunto <hi>Hacket</hi> (the ſaid 8th of <hi>June)</hi> anſwering by Letter to ſmall purpoſe, and ſubſcribing his Letter thus, <hi>As you find me, ſo call me: Coppinger</hi> therefore returned in anſwer another Letter preſently unto him, whereby he ſignified, that <hi>Hacket</hi> muſt manifeſt ſomewhat more plainly of ſome practice worth the revealing, otherwiſe they both ſhould worthily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s indignation; for that which he had then writ, would not ſatisfy her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and the State, concerning the danger which <hi>Hacket</hi> ſuppoſed to be coming upon the Land, and wherewith he ſeemed to be acquainted.</p>
                  <p>Upon ſuch overture (as afore is touched) made to one of the ſaid Lords, he had the <note place="margin">Both of them are examin'd by one of the Lords, who finds little in their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo ſhakes them off.</note> ſaid two Appeachers before him on the 10th of <hi>June:</hi> but finding <hi>Hacket</hi>'s demeanour of himſelf very ſtrange, and their Imputations as frivolous, he diſmiſſed them (as is ſaid) without further ado, to their great diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Hereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi> (in ſtomach ſo far as he durſt) writ another Letter to

the ſaid Nobleman the 11th of <hi>June:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſignified, That were it not that he had been before acquainted with the Graces and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which he did aſſure himſelf to be in <hi>Hacket</hi> in an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> manner, he ſhould have eſteemed of him (by his behaviour) as his Lordſhip did. Therefore what trouble or danger ſoever might come to himſelf by it, he was reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to abide it; and further chargeth the ſaid <hi>Nobleman</hi> (in God's name) to deliver the Letters and Copies there incloſed to her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> ſignifying, that what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould in that reſpect be allotted to him, or unto <hi>Hacket,</hi> they would undergo it, and not depart the City, till they might further underſtand what God would do therein. Sure it is, that (being thus ſhaken <note place="margin">They thus ſlighted, grow malicious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. <hi>Coppinger</hi> writes another Letter in <hi>Hacket</hi>'s name to the Queen, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dreadful Judgments from God, and offers a Sign.</note> off by him) they grew extremely malicious alſo againſt the ſaid worthy Nobleman.</p>
                  <p>I find alſo a Copy of a Letter written in <hi>Coppinger</hi>'s hand, but meant to be ſent as from <hi>Hacket,</hi> unto her Excellent <hi>Majeſty;</hi> wherein (amongſt other things) he deſireth he may enjoy that which God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and then lewdly and falſly accuſeth and revileth two great and worthy <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</hi> In the end he ſaith, That <hi>if he ſhould tell her the judgments of God that lie at her Gate (which the Lord hath ſhewed him) they would be over-fearful for her to endure, or to hear of. And if ſhe doubted of his ſending from the Lord, he willeth her to ask a Sign, and if he give it not, let him die.</hi>

A ſecond courſe taken by them beſides the former Appeachments, was a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">They conſpire the death of ſome Lords of the Council, in caſe Judgment be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors.</note> of the death of certain of the Lords of the <hi>Council,</hi> when they ſhould be at the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, in caſe they ſhould give any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt certain that were (ſometime) Preachers, and are now Priſoners for Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors perillous to the peaceable ſtate of the Realm, as is intended.

That about the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> or not long before, he heard <hi>Hacket</hi> ſinging of certain Songs, who then wiſhed that <hi>Arthington</hi> had alſo ſome of them: For it was a very ſpecial thing, and (ſaid he) <hi>M. Wiggington</hi> hath a great many of them.</p>

                  <p>Their laſt and moſt damnable Deſignment <note place="margin">Their laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was the deſtruction of the Queen.</note> of all, was the deprivation of her Sacred Majeſty from her Crown and Dignity, and the deſtruction of her Royal Perſon, whom the Eternal God (in mercy) long preſerve, to the confuſion of all Seditious Wretches her Enemies of all ſorts.</p>
                  <p>The very particular and principal means how theſe deviliſh Purpoſes were meant to be effected by them, <hi>Arthington</hi> now ſaith, that they were not opened unto him; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that though the other two ſeemed willing to have imparted ſome of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets unto him, yet himſelf was always unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear any of them.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98319:111"/>
he ſaith that this was a ſecret Myſtery (as <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> affirmed to him) which they would keep to themſelves, and were ſo enjoined of the Lord. But whether ſoever the way to effect theſe, was meant by ſome open violence, or ſecret practice; ſure it is, that popular Tumult was not the leaſt means they truſted of, to bring them to paſs, which they hoped to ſtir up by their pretence of ſo great holineſs, with calling the Realm to repentance in the open Streets of <hi>London,</hi> by offering joys and mercy to the Penitent, and by their Proclamation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo then made in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> as hereafter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be declared.</p>
                  <p>Now that theſe their two laſt Purpoſes were indeed the principal and main ends which they propounded to themſelves (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which by the way is noted alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that which comes hereafter to be mentioned) let theſe few Proofs enſuing ſuffice.

to pray for her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but then (he ſaid) that he put on his Hat. And when <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> demanded why he did ſo, <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſtreightway anſwered thus, There is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that. Likewiſe when as (in their private Prayers amongſt themſelves) <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> uſed to pray for the <hi>Queen, Coppinger</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Coppinger <hi>and</hi> Hacket <hi>forbear to pray for the Queen.</hi>

For (ſaith he) you do not know this man (meaning <hi>Hacket)</hi> who is a greater Perſon than ſhe, and indeed above all the Princes in the World.</p>
                  <p>And whenas on the very <hi>Sunday</hi> before their riſing (for ſo themſelves have ſince termed that Action) it happened that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> prayed again for the preſervation of the <hi>Queen's Majeſty: Hacket</hi> (not digeſting this) ſuddenly with indignation turned his face away from him, but when he prayed for other matters, then <hi>Hacket</hi> caſt his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance towards him again; which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo marked by him, and purpoſing (as it ſeemeth) to ſalve up this matter again, (left <hi>Arthington</hi> happily might yet have fallen from them) therefore when they had ended their Prayers, <hi>Hacket</hi> took him with his Arms about the middle (in very kind ſort) affirming, that he loved the <hi>Queen</hi> as well as either of them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98319:113"/>
him not to be offended, for the Lord had commanded it: Adding further, that there was a matter in it that <hi>Arthington</hi> as yet knew not. Hereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi> (being in hearing thereof) ſaid, that ſhe might be prayed for in general terms, but not ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as <hi>Arthington</hi> did (whereby <hi>Hacket</hi> was grieved) nor yet to be prayed for as a <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:</hi> For (ſaid he) ſhe may not reign as <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Sovereign,</hi> but this man <hi>Hacket;</hi> and yet (ſaith he) ſhe ſhall live better than ever ſhe did, albeit ſhe muſt be governed by another, thereby alſo meaning <hi>Hacket.</hi> And to the intent they might the more aſſuredly retain <hi>Arthington</hi> without ſuſpicion of their poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful malice (wherein they boiled againſt the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Highneſs) <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf (once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this time) very ſubtilly prayed for her <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For proof that they alſo meant to deprive her of life, the ſeveral Confeſſions of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hacket</hi> on a time recounting up unto the other two his Torments (which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have endured) told, how (amongſt others) one <hi>Pigg</hi> a Preacher did ſo beat him with Rods at a place in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> (whilſt he lay bound there in a Sink-hole) that this coſt him the ſaid <hi>Hacket</hi> more dear, than all the reſt of his Torments; becauſe thereby he was enforced to ſuffer for all Hypocrites alſo; adding thereunto, that all their beſt Preachers (ſo they term ſuch as thirſt after and perſuade Innovations) were no better in very truth than <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> nevertheleſs he <note place="margin">They account their Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Preachers Hypocrites and Idolaters for their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Laws of the Church.</note> would (he ſaid) daily hear them preach. Hereupon <hi>Arthington</hi> took occaſion to tell him, that he could prove all ſuch Preachers to be <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi> both (albeit of ignorance) becauſe they do yield (in ſome ſort) to the Commandments of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and unto the Laws of this Church, that they may be tolerated to preach.</p>
                  <p>This pleaſed <hi>Hacket</hi> ſo exceedingly well, as that he began highly to eſteem of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,</hi> and hereby the rather he thought good, that <hi>Arthington</hi> ſhould be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their Letters. For about ten days before their riſing <hi>(Arthington</hi> ſaith) that <hi>Coppinger</hi> did greatly importune him to read the Letters which he and <hi>Hacket</hi> had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98319:114"/>
written, if it were but to ſee the ſtile; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him they tended to nothing elſe; but to make a way to acquaint her <hi>Majeſty</hi> with their Secrets. So that when <hi>Arthington</hi> ſaw ſo great Counſellors ſo reſolutely thereby charged with matter of ſo high quality, by <hi>Coppinger</hi> eſpecially (her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s ſworn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) he was induced to believe it, and to think they had ſome very good ground thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arthington</hi> alſo (with great contentment unto <hi>Hacket)</hi> framed certain Syllogiſms (I believe) in a lewd <hi>Mode,</hi> and in an unperfect and fond <hi>Figure,</hi> to prove (forſooth) one of the ſaid honourable Counſellors (whom he and <hi>Coppinger</hi> villanouſly afterward proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traitors) to be ſuch as they do charge him to be. This worthy work of <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being firſt finiſhed, his other Treatiſe (to prove thoſe Preachers to be <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Idolaters)</hi> was ſtraightway ſet upon the ſtocks, and began to be built on the <hi>Monday</hi> before their riſing; after they all had (for obtaining good ſucceſs in this and the reſt of their buſineſs) <hi>humbled themſelves on the Lord's day</hi>

If the ſaid <hi>Hacket</hi> (as the Meſſenger of God's Vengeance, where mercy is refuſed) do not bring ſuch great Plagues upon this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> the like whereof was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen: In theſe, and in every of theſe ſeveral Caſes, he prayeth the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <note place="margin">His dreadful Imprecations.</note> him.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon he inferreth, that having thus denounced ſo many fearful Woes againſt his own Soul, as would ſink it into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit of Hell, if he were guilty in any one of them. Then thereupon with chearfulneſs he cometh to declare his Meſſage to <hi>England,</hi> accuſing it to be the moſt rebellious, though it have been moſt bleſſed of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then he affirmeth the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and the Courts of <hi>Juſtice</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the counterfeit Worſhip of God with Croſs and Surpleſs, to be worſe than <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> or the Purple Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe deſireth to be confounded.

Alſo the light and enticing behaviour of ſome Women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and his familiarity with them, whereby his Wife became jealous of him,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98319:118"/>
ſo that he was forced (for her ſatisfaction) to clear himſelf by his Oath. The ſundry Baits laid by means of ſome of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (that envied him for the credit he had with thoſe whom he ſerved) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him with Women. His attempting them in diſhoneſt manner, but with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe only (as he there pretendeth) to learn of them the Practices againſt him. The like Snares laid for him by ſome of better place and credit than the former: Of his affliction in mind that he endured, becauſe he ſo behaved himſelf toward Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and yet could not learn out by them the plot laid againſt him: Of his going into <hi>Hampſhire</hi> to have been placed there: How he was in a place there (for the moſt part of 20 days) beat with a Boſtonado, and into what pitiful ſtate of Body he was thereby brought: That this was done, partly for his avouching that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Head of the Church, againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and for ſaying, That as certain Earthen Pots were there by him broken, ſo ſhould all <hi>Papiſts</hi> be broken in Hell, and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo many as roſe up againſt him in Earth: How he was forced to uſe the Deputy-Lieutenant of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> his Aid, to be ſafely conveyed out of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, leſt he ſhould be murthered by his Enemies: That he came thence to one M. <hi>Paul Wentworth</hi>'s Houſe, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a Month, and was uſed moſt Chriſtianly, and where he was moſt deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98319:118"/>
exerciſed in the Spirit: How as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the way out of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> he told a Gentleman in company (that was privy to his Enemies Complots) of a great Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice intended againſt him, and to be done in a Chamber, by certain Perſons, whom he then named aforehand: Inſomuch as the ſaid Gentleman (being made privy to ſuch purpoſe, and knowing that he ſaid true) affirmed, ſurely he could conjure, or elſe it had not been poſſible to tell ſuch things as he did; where indeed (he ſaith) the Lord, in the midſt of his former Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, revealed it unto him, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewed him a Place which he had appointed for him, and how he would bring all his Enemies Practices to confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: How in performance of that which was ſo revealed, he was afterward in a certain Place in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> bound, firſt in a Chamber, and then chained in a Sink-hole of a Seller, and moſt grievouſly many ways afflicted there for 20 days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: That in the greateſt extremity thereof (which was greater than he could expreſs) a <hi>Croſs</hi> came upon his Breaſt as he lay, and always when his Torments were at the greateſt, the Lord unlooſed his Feet and Hands from his Fetters, and Bands; nevertheleſs he lay ſtill till his Tormentors came, and bound him again: How the Lord then appeared to him, and aſſured him, that he would eſtabliſh the Goſpel by him, and ſhewed him all the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98319:119"/>
Whoredom of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the perſon of a great Perſonage (ſince deceaſed) as it were in Candle-light, with a great Bell full of iniquity: That during that time, the Lord ſhewed him a terrible Famine which he would bring upon a Land, but whether this Land or not, was not declared: That <hi>Chriſt</hi> then ſhewed him his Wiſdom and Providence, in governing the Seas, and all other Waters in their Courſes: And further ſhewed him the Man that ſhould ſit on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Right hand, to judge both the quick and the dead, whoſe Name he well knoweth: That then he made his Petition unto the Lord, who anſwered him by a Voice, thus, <hi>What he would, how he would, and when he would:</hi> How (by the extremity of his Torments) his Eyes were fallen down, and his Tongue thruſt out of his Head, ſo as he could not pull it in again one Barley-corn's breadth; but the Lord in that extremity ſhewed him, that he would keep his Body from hurſting, and that one hair of his Head ſhould not periſh: That being looſed (by his Wife's importunity) ſoon after, in a very Rainy-day, he, his Wife, one <hi>Richard Dickens,</hi> and one <hi>Palmer,</hi> rid altogether thence toward <hi>Oundell,</hi> thirty Miles that day; and albeit it rained all the day very fore (ſo that great floods came upon it) yet never a one of them had any drop thereof fall upon their Clothes: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Oundell,</hi> and foreſeeing he ſhould
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98319:119"/>
be exerciſed again, he prayed his Wife that no man might come at him, for he would keep his Chamber: And then the Lord appeared unto him, and ſhewed him in what danger the Land was, by reaſon of foreign Enemies at the Sea; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go round about the Town, and that ſhould be a defence to the Land round about: That after this he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Barn about eight days, reaſoning with the Lord touching <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> continually begging of him, that he would ſave all thoſe that fought ignorantly againſt the Truth, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſinned through want of knowledge: How (after this) betaking himſelf to his Chamber again, the Lord (he ſaith) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to cry out againſt two great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and <hi>Counſellors</hi> in this Land: That he was again bound and tormented there other twenty days, in eight whereof, he neither did eat nor drink, and was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually watched, for that they knew the Lord would come and looſe him, if they left him: That during this time Witches uſed their Sorcery ſtrongly upon him: That the Lord then told him that he would harden his own heart againſt <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Tormentors: How then alſo four or five Angels night by night ſtood by him, and watched over him, like unto Doves, and one night Spirits innumerable: And that a white Hand came from the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and took him by the hand, whereby all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98319:120"/>
Venome, Poiſon, Uncleanneſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption departed from him for a time: whereupon the Lord ſhewed him three Heavens together, and all the dwelling places contrived in one of them, but the higheſt Heaven was ſhewed to be without end, which glory he was not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, but was made able to look upon the Blood of the Saints, which was made round like a Wax Cake, in very great breadth, but the glory which therewith appeared, he could not look upon, ſo that he was forced to turn his face upon the Pillow: How the Lord alſo ſhewed him the murthering of the Wicked, even like the ſlaying of Swine, the Father murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son, and the Mother the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and every one another, all the day long, and no man took pity upon them: That there was then revealed unto him a very ſtrange fire from Heaven, the length whereof he did ſee conſuming all things from the Heaven to Hell mouth, but he did not ſee the breadth thereof: Alſo that he then did ſee the breadth of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting place of the Damned, and what was therein, but neither the bottom, nor length of the place: That he alſo ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he ſaw his Liberty begged by two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſonages: Notwithſtanding which deliverance (that he dreamed of) he telleth that he was carried afterward to <hi>Northampton</hi> Gaol, where he remained 17 Weeks, as afore is remembred. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98319:120"/>
there is declared, That in his Torments the Lord ſhewed him how he would confound all his Adverſaries that were guilty in any practice againſt him, and that one thing which they went about, they ſhould never bring to paſs; for he let him ſee, that they were all as drunken men, and Fools without wit: That in the end they ſhould throw all their Books away, and be at a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion one with another: That afterward <hi>(viz.</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term laſt) the Lord brought him to <hi>London,</hi> and how he was made acquainted with <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> at that time, as hath been afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: How after his departing out of the City from <hi>Coppinger,</hi> he could not but remember him in his Prayers; deſiring the Lord to reveal himſelf <hi>extraordinarily</hi> to him, ſo <hi>that he might be encouraged</hi> to go forward in the Action: Whereupon (as the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> affirmed) <hi>he had two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Seals in very ſhort ſpace after</hi> Hacket'<hi>s departure, and was wonderfully ſtrengthened to proceed in the Cauſe.</hi> Then is told how the Lord commanded him to go from one place to another in and about the City, for two days ſpace; and how he was commanded to rail againſt the ſaid two great <hi>Counſellors,</hi> in divers places where he came: How being (in that time) commanded to ſee the Lyons in the <hi>Tower,</hi> he took the fierceſt of them by the Head, and had none harm: Then is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98319:121"/>
told what Preachers in the City he heard, and that going to hear one, he ſaw a Surpleſs lie in the Church, whereupon he would not ſtay there: That he went to certain Preachers in Priſon, to command them to deal faithfully in the Lord's buſineſs: And how he was commanded by God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Arms of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Kaye</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Knight-Rider's-ſtreet.</hi> Laſtly, It is ſaid, that God hath appointed two others to deal for, and with <hi>Hacket,</hi> whom it will ſtand upon to deal faithfully for the Lord, for they know what <hi>Hacket</hi> is, and what ſhall follow, if their Counſels and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections be not followed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now if any ſhall marvail, how ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous lying Legend ſhould ſeduce men of any conſideration, ſo earneſt for a ſuppoſed</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>and ſo exerciſed in praying and faſting; let him remember, not only the effectual, but the efficacy it ſelf of illuſion, and the ſpirit of ſlumber, falling (by God's ſecret, yet always juſt Judgment) upon the Children of diſobedience, ſuch as be wiſe in their own conceits, and not wiſe with ſobriety; that they might believe Lies, becauſe they have not believed the Truth: And that they might ask and not obtain, becauſe they ask not as they ought.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>After <hi>Arthington</hi> (On <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning) had ended his aforeſaid Treatiſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy (being the very day before their riſing) <hi>Coppinger</hi> told him, that God (the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98319:121"/>
night before) had enlightned him the ſaid <hi>Coppinger,</hi> who they all three were, ſaying, that <hi>Arthington</hi> had unawares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied truly; for he was the greateſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God's Judgments</hi> againſt the whole World that ever was, but that they both were greater than he; for <hi>Coppinger</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was (he ſaid) the greateſt that ever was, and laſt <hi>Prophet of mercy:</hi> and that he muſt deſcribe the new and holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with the ſeveral places of joy that the Elect ſhould enjoy after this Life, and that they the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſeparate the Lambs from the Goats before the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> at the laſt day. Whereat (it is ſaid) they were both aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, conſidering their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfitneſs, crying out againſt themſelves and their Sins; yet ſubmitting themſelves to the direction of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they were aſſured ſhould ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furniſh them to do him that ſervice which himſelf did command. Then <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> proceeded to tell further, That <hi>Hacket</hi> was greater than either of them, and that they two muſt obey him in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he commanded, but told not then what, nor how great he was, other than King of <hi>Europe;</hi> which Title was (afore this time) concluded of amongſt them. Hereupon (according to <hi>Coppinger</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment) <hi>Arthington</hi> offered to honour <hi>Hacket</hi> with his Title of the King of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and to demean himſelf toward him
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98319:122"/>
accordingly. But <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf herein diſpenſed with him, until the time ſhould come, that he was to honour him before others, bidding him withal to be of good cheer; for (faith he) <hi>I ſerve a good Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who makes ſo dear accompt of me, that all the Devils in Hell, nor Men in Earth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take my life from me.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> (for confirmation of the like unto them two alſo) ſaid, that <hi>Arthington</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were poſſeſſed, not only with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, but alſo with <hi>Angelical</hi> Spirits, which <hi>Arthington</hi> taking to be true (by a great burning that he felt in himſelf after that time) did thereupon fancy to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that no power in Earth nor Hell could hurt either of them, becauſe they had the ſpirit of <hi>Angels,</hi> and they were ſubject to no Power, but to God alone: And that (God being the maſter of the whole Work) all things ſhould proſper with them, they only ſeeking his glory, which (he faith) he vowed with himſelf, and to deal throughly in his Office, to rebuke the World of Sin, and to denounce Judgments againſt whomſoever the Spirit ſhould move him, without fear or favour of Men, or of Devils in Hell: which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (he faith) then moved him (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his hatred afore conceived againſt them, and his opinion that they were Trayors againſt the <hi>Queen's Majeſty)</hi> to utter and to declare his deteſtation he had againſt the aforeſaid three worthy <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,</hi>

                     <p>By the way, we may note the ſubtil managing and carriage of this Action by <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Coppinger</hi> in this one principal Point, which <hi>Arthington</hi> himſelf alſo now obſerveth: <hi>Videlicet,</hi> in that they opened not at any time <hi>Hacket</hi>'s chief pretended Office unto <hi>Arthington; videlicet,</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to participate with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>'s Office (of ſevering with his Fan the good from the bad) until the very time they were to go into the Streets to do the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that <hi>Hacket</hi> enjoyned them. For hereby they prevented a doubt of driving <hi>Arthington</hi> back, who ſeemed a Man ſo ſerviceable for their purpoſe, as that he was worthy to be ſtill retained by them: and the rather, for that he had not yet finiſhed the writing up of <hi>Hacket's Hiſtory</hi> that was to be annexed to the <hi>Prophecy)</hi> until late that <hi>Thurſday</hi> night which was afore their riſing, for they might have feared (if leiſure had ſerved him to have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98319:123"/>
conſidered of it, and examined it at full how this could be) leſt it might have made him at leaſt to ſtagger, and be doubtful of it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, <hi>Hacket</hi> kept (as <hi>Arthington</hi> now gathereth) that honour wholly to himſelf to proclaim it to them both together, as it were by a Voice from Heaven, at that very inſtant when they ſhould receive their charge of him; and thereby have no time to reaſon againſt it, being ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to go forward as obedient Perſons to him in all things.</p>
                     <p>Thus that <hi>Thurſday</hi> paſſed on. On <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſent his Man <hi>Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (by Five of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) unto <hi>Arthington</hi>'s Lodging, but his Wife would not then awake him; ſo he ſent for him again at Six, and they two then went together unto <hi>Coppinger.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> determined (that <hi>Friday</hi> morning, being the 16th day of <hi>July</hi> laſt) between Six and Seven of the Clock in the forenoon, to go unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gentleman's Houſe about the City, of good behaviour, and they forſooth to honour him, to be chief Governor under her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which they alſo did that Morning, and promiſed unto him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that he ſhould ſo be. Leaving alſo with him both the ſaid <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Hacket's Hiſtory</hi> to peruſe, but the good Gentleman was unwilling to deal either with them or their Papers any way. They
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98319:123"/>
flayed not there above half an hour. From thence they came betwixt Eight and Nine of the Clock in the Morning unto <hi>Wigginton</hi>'s Chamber (being Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the <hi>Counter in Woodſtreet)</hi> with whom having much ſpeech and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (part whereof is touched before) among other things, they ſignified unto him, (as <hi>Arthington</hi> confeſſeth) <hi>that they were provoked to pronounce him the holieſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of all others, for dealing ſo plainly and reſolutely in God's Cauſes above all Miniſters, which God would manifeſt one day to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wigginton</hi> at his examination confeſſeth ſuch Conference by him at that time to have been had with them, and (as he was enjoined by thoſe who examined him) hath reported it by writing ſomewhat largely. He therein alſo ſetteth down a Conference had by him about the ſame matters with <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf, coming to him thither alone (as he ſaith) the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame <hi>Friday</hi> morning, ſome while after the other two were departed from him.</p>
                     <p>It may be gathered by his own Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that betwixt the time of <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi>'s talk with him, <hi>Wigginton</hi> had ſet down Article-wiſe, and diſtincted with number the ſeveral Heads of their Speeches had with him. And after he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo enquired and ſet down in writing <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Opinion likewiſe, unto every of the ſaid Articles ſeverally. And albeit it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98319:124"/>
need not be queſtioned, but that both for Circumſtance and Matter he would ſet it down, the leaſt that might be either to his own, or any his Complices diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, yet may it ſerve for the fuller un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the whole Action, and for neceſſary obſervation beſides, to touch ſome chief Points of thoſe Conferences, though it be but as himſelf telleth them.</p>

ſometimes before, in ſtrange terms, as theſe and ſuch like,</hi> viz. <hi>Father, I know thou loveſt me as well as thou loveſt thine own ſelf.</hi> Thus when <hi>Hacket</hi> had anſwered <hi>Wigginton</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands touching <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi>'s Speeches (as is afore ſet down) <hi>he ſaid he would depart home into the Country; yet he would leave word behind, for his Adverſaries to know in what place they ſhould find him, if they were diſpoſed to call for him. And withal made great ſhew (after his former wonted manner) as though he neither feared Magiſtrate, nor cared for any puniſhment, nor doubted any danger to enſue upon him, for any thing he had done or ſaid, or ſhould go about.</hi>

                     <p>Now touching ſome things markable in <note place="margin">Remarks on <hi>Wigginton</hi>'s Narration.</note> this Narration of <hi>Wigginton</hi>'s. Firſt, If <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> ſay true in his Confeſſions; That <hi>Hacket</hi> publiſhed not himſelf to have that <note place="margin">1.</note> Office of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his principal Spirit, till the very moment that they were to go into the City to proclaim (as they did) and if they went not unto <hi>Hacket</hi> that day till they had firſt been with <hi>Wigginton,</hi> which ſeemeth to be true; then could it not be, that <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton</hi> heard that of them two at that time, which he reporteth them to have ſpoken in the firſt, ſecond, third and fourth Article; and therefore he was made acquainted with it before that time. Secondly, That which <note place="margin">2.</note> he maketh <hi>Hacket</hi> to fumble about ſomewhat doubtfully in anſwer to the fourth Article (touching the old Magiſtrates that were gone,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98319:128"/>
and of new) doth argue, that <hi>Wigginton</hi> was alſo made privy to the Intent of diſplacing all the old Counſellors, and placing of new, as was plotted by the Conſpirators. Thirdly, <note place="margin">3.</note> Their lewd and malepert imputation of her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Honour to be blemiſhed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ſhe was undone, though it had been no more, were matters of that quality, that no dutiful or well-adviſed Subject would have either concealed, or ſo lightly paſſed over as he did. Fourthly, It is probable, <note place="margin">4.</note> that <hi>Hacket</hi> meant rather to have Mattocks turned into Spears, than contrariwiſe; for I ſee no peaceable means that was thought on by them. Fifthly, We may obſerve that <note place="margin">5.</note> here is a Reformation moved, which upon pain of damnation muſt be undertaken, and that with all ſpeed; even <hi>Now,</hi> (they ſay) wherein others beſide the <hi>Queen</hi> have their parts to perform in erecting of it; ſome whereof have alſo <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts and Callings to run in that courſe of Reforming; and <hi>Wigginton</hi> (being yet a Priſoner, but belike put in hope of ſpeedy deliverance by their means) is appointed a principal Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to them; yea, and is made privy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome matter, for which <hi>Hacket</hi> thought he was not unlike to be afterward ſought for, and which he knew might be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous unto him, had he been ſuch a man, as any Magiſtrate, Puniſhment or Danger might have diſmayed, and yet not ſought to be revealed by <hi>Wigginton</hi> unto any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, till upon his examination it was found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98319:128"/>
out. Laſtly, I obſerve the <hi>Coggery</hi> of the <note place="margin">6,</note> Reporter, or elſe the lewd lying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to himſelf of that wretched Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer <hi>Hacket.</hi> For in his Anſwer to the fifth and ſixth Articles, he knows no degrees of glory in Heaven; and yet in his Anſwer to the eighth, he aſſigneth more honour and higher places in Heaven unto ſome few that <hi>are the moſt forward,</hi> than he doth unto others.</p>
                     <p>But let us go on with the Narration of the principal Action, interrupted by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Conferences had with <hi>Wigginton,</hi> and of his report of them.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>From <hi>Wigginton</hi>'s Lodging the ſaid <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hacket'<hi>s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory continued.</hi>
                           </note> and <hi>Arthington</hi> came directly to <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Broken Wharf,</hi> and there found the Beaſt in Bed after Eight of the Clock: Where being enflamed (they ſay) with zeal out of all meaſure, <hi>Coppinger</hi> began to pray at the Bed's feet, and <hi>Arthington</hi> joined with him; wherein they ſtood much upon their own unworthineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their obedience to do as the Lord ſhould direct them by his Spirit, having already done ſo much as was enjoined them. Whereupon <hi>Hacket</hi> came out of his Bed, and prayed with them in his Shirt twice, that the Spirit might direct them, and they likewiſe obey the ſame in all things, to the glory of God only. After <hi>Hacket</hi>'s latter Prayer, <hi>Coppinger</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98319:129"/>
to go on in his Prayer, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Spirit moved <hi>Arthington</hi> to interrupt him, and to charge him in the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ariſe and anoint the King with the Holy Ghoſt. Whereupon <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſtraightway roſe up, and three times kiſſed the Boards under his feet, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up after every time, and making great reverence with bowed knee; and after the third time he came towards <hi>Hacket</hi> as he lay in his Bed, who put out his hand, and took <hi>Coppinger</hi> by the hand, and ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not need to anoint me,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Blaſphemy.</note> 
                           <hi>for I have been already anointed in Heaven by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, what his pleaſure was to be done, <hi>Go your way both</hi> (ſaid he, as <hi>Arthington</hi> reports) <hi>and tell them in the City, that Chriſt Jeſus is come with his Fan in his hand to judge the Earth. And if any man ask you where he is, tell them he lies at</hi> Walker'<hi>s Houſe by</hi> Broken Wharf: <hi>and if they will not believe it, let them: come and kill me, if they can; for as truly as Chriſt Jeſus is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo truly is he come to judge. the world.</hi> Then <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſaid it ſhould be done forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and thereupon went forward, and <hi>Arthington</hi> followed ſo readily the ſaid <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Mercy,</hi> that he had no leiſure to take his Gloves with him, and ere <hi>Arthington</hi> could get down the Stairs, <hi>Coppinger</hi> had begun (in the Houſe below) to proclaim News from Heaven of exceeding great Mercy: That <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98319:129"/>
as above is ſaid, with whom <hi>Arthington</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cried the ſame words aloud, following him along the Streets from thence by <hi>Watling-ſtreet</hi> and <hi>Old Change,</hi> towards <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> they both adding beyond their Commiſſion, theſe words, <hi>Repent</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>Repent.</hi> But ſurely either their Commiſſion was delivered them (at one time or other) more largely than the one of them now reporteth; or elſe they went beyond and exceeded it in many other material Points beſides this. For after they both had thus come (with mighty concourſe of the common multitude as to ſuch a novelty of hearing two new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in theſe days ariſen was likely) with an uniform cry into <hi>Cheapſide</hi> near unto the Croſs: and there finding the throng and preſs of People to encreaſe about them, in ſuch ſort as that they could not well paſs further, nor be conveniently heard of them all, as they deſired; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they got them up into an empty Cart which ſtood there, and out of that choiſe Pulpit (fur ſuch a purpoſe) made their lewd and traiterous preachment unto the People: wherein they ſtood not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of their former cry, but (ſo near as I could learn from ſo common an Auditory, and in ſo confuſed an Action) they reading ſomething out of a Paper, went more particularly over the Office and Calling of <hi>Hacket;</hi> how he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by partaking a part of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98319:130"/>
Body; by his principal Spirit, and by the Office of ſevering the Good from the Bad with his Fan in his hand, and of eſtabliſhing the Goſpel in <hi>Europe</hi> (which as it ſeemeth they took to be all the World, or elſe ſuppoſed, that all <hi>Europe</hi> did profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity)</hi> and of bringing in that <hi>Diſcipline</hi> which they ſo often babble of, and which they mean by the term of <hi>Reformation, and the holy Cauſe:</hi> That he was now come, and all theſe things were preſently to be performed by him, telling alſo the People where they ſaw him, where he lay and remained: That they were two <hi>Prophets,</hi> the one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> the other of <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſent, and <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> called by God to aſſiſt him in this great Work, and were Witneſſes of theſe things: confirming the ſame upon their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and wiſhing themſelves confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and damned for ever, if theſe things they ſpoke, were not true. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the one of them pronounced <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> great Comfort, and unſpeakable Joys to all that ſhould repent preſently, be obedient, and embrace this acceptable Meſſage and opportunity offered: And the other denounced terrible <hi>Judgments,</hi> if they repented not, which ſhould even preſently (alſo) fall upon them, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially upon that City of <hi>London;</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all that believed them not, were condemned Body and Soul. This Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>London</hi> (as <hi>Arthington</hi> the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98319:130"/>
pretended <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſaith he gathered out of <hi>Hacket's Hiſtory)</hi> was, that men ſhould (there) kill and maſſacre one another (as Butchers do kill Swine) all the day long, and no man ſhould take compaſſion of them. There was then and there further delivered by them, or by the one of them, that <hi>Hacket</hi> was King of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo ought to be obeyed and taken; and that all Kings muſt hold of him, and that the <hi>Queen's Majeſty</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited her Crown, and was worthy to be deprived. Which moſt traiterous Point amongſt others <hi>Hacket</hi> enjoined them to publiſh, as in the one of his Indictments is contained. Laſtly, In very unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly and ſawey terms they prayed to God to confound two great Lords of her Majeſty's Counſel; for theſe two, (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a certain Knight) they then and there openly and moſt lewdly accuſed in general terms of Treaſon. This outrage was done the ſixteenth day of <hi>July</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, about Ten of the Clock, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after, in the Forenoon.</p>
                        <p>By which their Proclamation, being laid together with their former Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, Letters, and Purpoſes againſt the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Counſel,</hi> and for advancing of <hi>Hacket,</hi> and for altering the State, with the very time (when ſo many Soldiers were about the City) it is evident to any, who hath but half an eye to ſee with, that they intended and hoped to move
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98319:131"/>
Tumult and Sedition: That by many hands of the common multitude (which they brag of, ſaying, they <hi>are already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with zeal)</hi> they might have brought all their Purpoſes at length to a ſure and ſpeedy concluſion; which deſignment, for their pretended <hi>Reformation,</hi> this ſort of People do greatly lament, ſo long to have been fruſtrated, after ſo many other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kind of means, in vain attempted by them. But God <hi>(who ſtayeth the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the waters, and the madneſs of his people)</hi> did fruſtrate them herein of their purpoſe and expectation: his Name be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways praiſed therefore.</p>
                        <p>And whereas they had purpoſed to have gone with the like cry and proclamation through other the chief parts of the City, the preſs (not of Officers to take them, but of common People to gaze and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at them) was ſo great, as that they were forced to go into a Tavern in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> at the Sign of the <hi>Mermaid;</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe a Gentleman in a white Doublet, being of his Acquaintance, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Coppinger</hi> whilſt he was in the Cart, and rebuked him for his ſtrange and lewd Demeanour and Speeches.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon (though <hi>Arthington</hi> were offended with the ſaid Gentleman for touching a Prophet of God in ſo rough a ſort as he ſaid) yet they were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſlep aſide into the ſaid Tavern with him; where when they had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98319:131"/>
a ſpace, <hi>Coppinger</hi> was perſuaded by one of the aforeſaid <hi>Lawſon</hi>'s Men, that ſtaid there at that time (for avoiding the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and preſs of the People) to ſtep over into <hi>Woodſtreet,</hi> and from thence by back Lanes to his Siſter's Houſe near unto <hi>Paul's Wharf,</hi> where he lodged. But whilſt they two were going together, <hi>Coppinger</hi> was very careful to know whether <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> followed them or not; inſomuch as he would not be ſatisfied, till the ſaid Apprentice went back again for him. At whoſe coming back, he found <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> ſtill publiſhing his foreſaid Meſſages to the People, and telling them of <hi>Hacket,</hi> and of his Office, with whom <hi>Arthington</hi> was content alſo at laſt to go by the ſame Streets that <hi>Coppinger</hi> had gone, but yet crying (as he did afore) <hi>Repent</hi> England, <hi>Repent,</hi> &amp;c. When in this ſort they two were come together to <hi>Coppinger</hi>'s Lodging, they found the Gates ſhut againſt them; whereupon the ſaid Apprentice would have had <hi>Arthington</hi> to have gone to his own Lodging, but he would needs go to <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Broken Wharf,</hi> where not long before he left <hi>Hacket.</hi> All the way that <hi>Arthington</hi> went, he was followed by a great multitude of Lads and young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the meaner ſort: But at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Hacket</hi> was not yet returned out of the City from <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98319:132"/>
After that <hi>Arthington</hi> was entred the Houſe, he was there ſtaid by one <hi>Edward Jones,</hi> an honeſt Citizen: And when <hi>Hacket</hi> (not long after) came in, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> ſaid, There cometh the King of the Earth. But <hi>Hacket</hi> willed him to keep ſilence, telling him he was too outragious: whereupon he ſtraightway (in very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful manner) obeyed; for he called <hi>Hacket</hi> his Captain, and ſaid, That he would do whatſoever he commanded him to do.</p>
                        <p>When the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> (in ſearching about <hi>Arthington)</hi> found a Writing in his Sleeve, <hi>Arthington</hi> ſaid, That fell out as he would have it, for now it would be ſeen; for he had made (he ſaid) an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and ſhe would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and therefore ſhe was (he ſaid) no longer <hi>Queen,</hi> but was deprived of her Crown, <hi>Hacket</hi> ſaying nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>There was found alſo in <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hidden at the Bed's feet, many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and <hi>Walker</hi> (the Owner of the Houſe) brought alſo unto the ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> other Writings of theirs out of a Stable.</p>
                        <p>And when Maſter <hi>Heyney,</hi> Parſon of the Church of St. <hi>Mary-Somerſets,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and learned Preacher, looked on one of the ſaid Papers, <hi>Hacket</hi> reproving him, ſaid, that it appertained not unto him, but unto the Magiſtrates, to look on them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98319:132"/>
                           <hi>Arthington</hi> (in Speeches with the ſaid <hi>Heyney)</hi> ſaid amongſt other things, That the Judgments of God over that City were very great, and that the time was now come, that God would reform his Church univerſally, and root out all Idolatrous Prieſts, and that the Miniſters of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were no better; affirming himſelf to be a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſent purpoſely from God to denounce his Judgments, and that <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> was a greater Prophet than he: That <hi>Cartwright</hi> was a great learned Man, and a Saint of God; but <hi>Wigginton</hi> was leſs learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than he, yet far before him in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for his Zeal; always concluding his Speeches with theſe words of imprecation againſt himſelf, viz. <hi>elſe God confound me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>When the ſaid Preacher demanded of <hi>Hacket,</hi> why he had ſeduced <hi>Arthington</hi> to bring him into ſuch Blaſphemies? his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, that abundance of Zeal did cauſe him to exceed in that ſort. Then he asked <hi>Hacket,</hi> how he liked that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi> aſcribed unto him an Office pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> To which he would not directly anſwer, but ſaid, that God had a great Work to bring to paſs by himſelf in this Land; affirming that himſelf alſo was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and had endited that <hi>Prophecy</hi> (which <hi>Arthington</hi> writ) to be ſent to the <hi>Queen</hi> or <hi>Counſel,</hi> and that he prayed to God to direct <hi>Arthington</hi>'s Pen therein.</p>
                        <p>This ſtrange Accident being quickly blown through the City, all was in a buz,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98319:133"/>
and in a kind of aſtoniſhment, what to think of the matter: And being ſpeedily brought to her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s ears, (then lying but at <hi>Greenwich)</hi> two of her honourable Counſel were preſently diſpatched unto <hi>London,</hi> to take further notice of the whole matter. About One of the Clock in the Afternoon <hi>Coppinger</hi> was ſent for, whilſt <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe honourable Counſellors and others at the <hi>Lord Mayors</hi> to be examined: but (as is informed) they would not ſhew any token of duty or reverence unto thoſe honourable Perſons, not ſo much as by putting off their Hats unto them. Then their Hats were plucked off by others, and they were told their duties, and were ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they did not know before whom they ſtood? To which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they knew them right well; nevertheleſs they would yield them no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor reverence, inſomuch as themſelves (they ſaid) were greater Perſons than thoſe before whom they were convented, yet they ſeemed well content to ſtand bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, ſo their Hats were taken off by force, and not put off by their own wills, This courſe of inſolent behaviour towards all that examined them, both <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> held on at ſundry other their Examinations. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Arthington</hi> that was ſo ſcrupulous to yield any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Queen's Counſel,</hi> and <hi>Officers,</hi> at one time when he ſaw <hi>Hacket,</hi> preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98319:133"/>
fell down groveling upon his face on the ground and honoured him, according to the Convention among them mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. And albeit both theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill reſolute in their former Fancies, conceived of their <hi>extrarordinary</hi> Callings and Offices, and ſought moſt abſurdly to defend it by Scripture, (but chiefly by moſt terrible Imprecations unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, praying to be confounded and damned if they ſaid not true:) yet to all Queſtions that were asked of them, they anſwered (though moſt confidently) yet pertinently, and directly to purpoſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Hacket</hi> uſed the matter ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more craftily, when any Queſtion of eſpecial danger was propunded unto him. For then would he by cunning Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by Cavils, and by fruſtratory kinds of Anſwers go about to put off ſuch Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, ſeeming when he was preſſed ſomewhat hard, to be weary of his Part and Perſon put on, if he could have then told how to have ſhaken it off, and been rid of it again with any honeſty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Coppinger</hi> (ſoon after his firſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) finding the event of things not to anſwer their expectations, ſeeing alſo the matter ſomewhat warmly taken (as there was good cauſe) and thereby gathering the danger which he and his Complices ſtood in, and perceiving alſo (by the Queſtions asked) the intercepting of their Writings and Letters, whereby their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98319:134"/>
were at full diſcovered and brought to light; began, either by his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary choiſe (as ſome perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably have imagined) or through anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety (indeed) of mind, growing forth of the badneſs of the Cauſe, to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Man diſtracted of his Wits. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as coming at one time to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and finding <hi>Hacket</hi> there, at his ſight he preſently roared out in a very ſtrange and horrible kind of voice; which <hi>Hacket</hi> willing to turn to the beſt, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſaid, It was no marvail, though <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> did now ſo behave himſelf, for that he had given him over already unto So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
                        <p>By peruſal of their Writings and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by their Examinations, all the Plots of Treaſon and Lewdneſs (afore mentioned) fell out very evidently, and more at full againſt them.</p>
                        <p>Touching the <hi>Queen's-Arms</hi> defaced at <hi>Kaye</hi>'s Houſe, <hi>Hacket</hi> did confeſs, at the times of his examination, that he did it, none other being preſent, and that he was moved thereunto inwardly by the Spirit, to take away her whole Power of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and that he would have done worſe, had it not been for diſquieting his Hoſteſs where he lay, becauſe when ſhe found it, ſhe was very angry therewith: For he was not ſorry, neither is ſorry (as he then ſaid) for doing the Act, becauſe he was commanded by God to do it, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98319:134"/>
durſt do no otherwiſe. He confeſſed alſo, that he was likewiſe moved to put out the Lions and the Dragons Eyes in the Arms; but being asked why he did ſo? he bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and maliciouſly anſwered, that he did know that Lions and Dragons did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict God's People. He did alſo raze out the Croſs that was pictured on the top of the Crown. He further confeſſed, That he meant alſo her Majeſty's Counſel ſhould be removed, becauſe they were (he ſaid) wicked; and that he himſelf (being moved by the Spirit) would have placed certain other new Counſellors (whom he then named) to wait upon the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to reform Religion. It is alſo confeſſed by him, that he told <hi>Arthington</hi> and others, that he was the anointed King of <hi>Europe.</hi> By the Depoſitions of the ſaid <hi>Kaye</hi> and his Wife, it appeareth, that they finding, (about a fortnight before <hi>Hacket</hi>'s depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them) the <hi>Queen's Majeſty</hi>'s Picture pricked with ſome Bodkin or Iron Inſtrument in the very place repreſenting her Royal Heart, did in great anger charge <hi>Hacket</hi> with it. Whereunto he anſwered, that he had done it, and muſt and would anſwer it; adding, he had greater Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to anſwer than that, and therefore (ſaid he) you need not make ſuch ado for it. But <hi>Hacket</hi> at all his Examinations either denied this Point ſlatly, or ſaid, he did not remember it. This Noble Heart, which thereby he ſo trayterouſly deſpited,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98319:135"/>
God of his infinite mercy long bleſs and continue ſtill moſt happy and hearty in his love and fear, within her Majeſties ſacred breaſt, maugre all ſuch execrable fiery ſpirits and hell-hounds in earth, and all the damned devils in hell. Amen.</p>
                        <p>Likewiſe he confeſſed, that he moved and ſent forth <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi> to go whither God ſhould ſend them, and to declare and publiſh, that there lay a Man (namely he the ſaid <hi>Hacket)</hi> at <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, which made claim to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>her Majeſty</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited her Crown, in that her Miniſters have uſed extraordinary means to ſet up Religion. This he confeſſed on the 21ſt and 23d of <hi>July.</hi> But at his former exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination on the 19th of <hi>July,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded whether he would acknowledg that the <hi>Queen's Majeſty</hi> is Lawful Queen of <hi>England</hi> or not? he ſubtilly then ſaid, he would not anſwer to that Queſtion, but ſaid ſhe was <hi>Queen of England yet,</hi> if ſhe had not forfeited the ſame. And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confeſſed (on 23d of <hi>July)</hi> that he Firſt publiſhed in <hi>Hamp-ſhire</hi> (about Three or Four Years paſt) and afterwards in <hi>Hartford-ſhire,</hi> and in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> that her <hi>Majeſty</hi> was not <hi>Queen,</hi> and that ſhe had forfeited her Title to the <hi>Crown:</hi> And that he told <hi>Arthington</hi> ſo much in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term. All theſe aforeſaid, were confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, without any Torture: but being Tortur'd, he then Sang another
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98319:135"/>
Song, and confeſſed her <hi>Majeſty</hi> to be his lawful <hi>Queen,</hi> and affirm'd, that he Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured her, and was Sorry for his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: adding, that if <hi>Coppinger, Wiggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and one other (whom he named) were well ſifted, and ſtraightly examined, they would utter and declare ſundry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Treaſon.</p>
                        <p>It fell out beſides upon depoſition of <hi>Kayes,</hi> that <hi>Coppinger</hi> (being told how <hi>Hacket</hi> had uſed the <hi>Queens</hi> Picture and the Arms) at the firſt ſeemed to miſlike with it, ſaying, that if he were ſuch a fellow, he had done with him; but (ſaith he) you muſt bear with him: for ſome great men have alſo born with him, and he is with you, but as it were a Priſoner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Coppinger</hi> himſelf alſo at that his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (which was taken the 19th of <hi>July)</hi> confeſſed, that the Letter then ſhewed to him, (and inferted afore) was the Copy of a Letter which he ſent to the ſaid <hi>John Udall</hi> about ten weeks then paſt, and that the cauſe why he wrote to <hi>Udall</hi> that <hi>he uſed not to repair unto him and the reſt who were in priſon, ſo often as he was wont to do, for doubt of more trouble and danger that might grow to them thereby,</hi> was, <hi>in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this action, which he had to do:</hi> He alſo then affirmed, that the <hi>Queens Majeſty, Queen Elizabeth,</hi> is not <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> neither is he (as he ſaid) now her ſervant, for <hi>Hacket</hi> is the only King of the World, and that <hi>Hacket</hi> was commanded by God
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98319:136"/>
to deface her Majeſties Arms which were in the Houſe where he then lay, and that <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo prick'd the Picture of the <hi>Queens Majeſty</hi> at the Heart. That himſelf, <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton,</hi> and one other (the very Week afore <hi>Wigginton</hi> was committed) had a Faſt together, where they Prayed, that if any of them ſhould have any <hi>extraordinary</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they might have ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> ſeal of it: about the which time, he the ſaid <hi>Coppinger</hi> was called in a Dream. And that he (together with <hi>Arthington,</hi> and one other) had a former Faſt at the aforeſaid <hi>Lancaſter's</hi> Houſe, about one Week afore that time: and that her Majeſties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel (that now are) muſt be Tryed by this King, whether they are to be remov'd from <hi>her Majeſty</hi> or not: and that ſhe is to have to be about her to attend her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (for the time) ſuch as himſelf ſhould aſſign, which ſhall be thoſe, whom he hath named in a Letter of his, that is found with him: and ſome others alſo (he ſaid) were meant to have been aſſigned alſo for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>There fell out alſo upon ſome of <hi>Arthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Examinations (while he remained ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate) certain other points not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be remembred. One was, that whereas he, in writing of a treatiſe againſt the ſtate of this Church as it now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, obſerved (as he ſaith) therein his old want to abſtain from bitter ſpeeches and raylings, as a thing which he naturally
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98319:136"/>
abhorred: yet within theſe few Months, and after he had entred into theſe actions, he had altred his opinion, and was moved, in ſpirit, to follow another ſharp and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting courſe of Writing, as being more convenient in his judgment. Alſo, when ſome that examined him, ſtood greatly upon this point, to perſuade him, that he was ſeduced in thoſe things wherein he ſeemed ſo reſolute: and reaſoned againſt ſuch their pretended <hi>extraordinary</hi> callings, gifts, and offices: then he (for better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof) ſaid; that it ſhould very ſhortly appear to the world, that they were no ſuch ſeduced perſons, as was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. For whereas a godly Gentlewoman in <hi>London</hi> (ſo he termed her) had been by the ſpace of 14 years poſſeſſed with a Devil, (as is afore touched) that (for a ſure ſign of their vocation) the ſaid Devil ſhould be thrown out of her, by all, or ſome of their three means, very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He alſo perſiſted wilful in his former fancies, until the very time that he knew <hi>Hacket</hi> was hanged; for until that day, he very confidently affirmed, that he was moſt aſſured by the Spirit of God, and by the joys and comfort he inwardly felt, that <hi>Hacket</hi> did participate with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a part of his office, and was indeed King of all <hi>Europe,</hi> on whom <hi>her Majeſty</hi> and all other, muſt hold their crowns and ſcepters, and muſt govern (if they would continue their government) by ſuch Laws, as he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98319:137"/>
ſhould preſcribe and ſet forth: That all they three ſhould ſhortly be diſmiſſed, and ſhould go over-Sea with <hi>Hacket,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of all thoſe his other Kingdoms abroad, and to perform their <hi>Offices.</hi> But when the vanity and danger of this ſtrange fancy was opened unto him, his anſwer was to this effect: You think (ſaith he ſomewhat pleaſantly, as it were pitying their error and miſconceit) that we have incurred the danger of laws herein; and that we ſhall therefore be put to death: but as ſure as God is in Heaven, the ſword ſhall not come near to hurt us, neither ſhall any man be able to touch the leaſt hair of any of our heads.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the mean time (for the moſt part <note place="margin">Hacket <hi>comes to his Tryal.</hi>
                           </note> thereof) from <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th of <hi>July,</hi> until <hi>Monday</hi> ſevennight after, being ſpent in examinations, it was thought good, that <hi>Hacket</hi> ſhould then come to his Tryal: on which day (being the 26th of <hi>July)</hi> he was brought from <hi>Bridewell</hi> to the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons-houſe near <hi>Newgate,</hi> before the <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Lord Wentworth, Sir Gilbert Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> Knight, Maſter of the Rolls, <hi>Sir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtane Dixie,</hi> and <hi>Sir Richard Martin</hi> Knights, <hi>Mr. Sergeant Fleetwood</hi> Recorder of <hi>London, Mr. Daniel</hi> and others in that Commiſſion: where after the Grand Jury was Empan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled, the Witneſſes that ſhould give evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Sworn, and two ſeveral Indictments againſt him found, <hi>Hacket</hi> was willed to hold up his hand, which he did: then the

ſhould be the ſooner ſuſpected; or to that effect: That there were Letters diſperſed in the ſtreets five or ſix days before the Action: That there were found in <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginton</hi>'s Chamber printed Pamphlets, which ſhould be ſent to a great number of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (whom I, quoth Maſter <hi>Attorney,</hi> forbear to name) as is touched before: That in other Letters was contained, That the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould command her Counſellors to their Chambers, becauſe of the ſtir and danger which then ſhould be: That <hi>Hacket</hi> himſelf had afore confeſſed (beſides the other Points of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) how he ſent <hi>Arthington</hi> and <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinger</hi> to do and proclaim as they did.</p>
                        <p>Then Maſter <hi>Sollicitor</hi> very excellently <note place="margin">The Subſtance of Mr. Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Speech.</note> alſo diſcourſed, How there was no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more dangerous than that which is practiſed under other colours, as it were in the clouds, and none wounded ſo deep as thoſe that were ſhadowed under the cloak of Religion and Zeal; for of it commonly followed greateſt deſtruction and calamities. This he exemplified by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> at <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and ſome others: That in like ſort (as (they did) this <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo affirmeth he was ſent from God, was a principal <hi>Angel</hi> ſent before the Judgment; that he doth participate (with horror I rehearſe it, ſaid Maſter <hi>Sollicitor)</hi> of the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the two other are <hi>Prophets,</hi> one of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the other
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98319:142"/>
of <hi>Judgment.</hi> That the <hi>Queen</hi> had forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Crown: That the Council was wicked, and muſt be over-ruled; and by whom but by him? &amp;c. Then he ſhewed what <hi>Hacket</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> a Bankrupt; that he had married a Widow, and had ſpent all.</p>
                        <p>Which done, Maſter <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> gave Judgment upon <hi>Hacket,</hi> as in like <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> gave Judgment for Execution.</note> caſes is accuſtomed. From thence <hi>Hacket</hi> was carried to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> next after (being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day for his Execution) that in the mean while he might (by godly counſel) be brought to Repentance, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his Soul's health. Certain Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſo travelled with him in the mean time, that albeit (for ſome while) he thought to advantage himſelf, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite his execution, by giving (through diſſimulation) froward and lewd An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; yet at length they brought him (as it then ſeemed) to a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own ſtate, and of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of his Treaſons. Inſomuch as Maſter <hi>Richard Young</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> coming <note place="margin">He is viſited by Preachers, is brought to ſober Temper:</note> alſo unto him thither, on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> being the 27th of <hi>July,</hi> betwixt the hours of ſix and ſeven in the Afternoon (ſundry others alſo being in company) he found him (in outward appearance) well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. For when Maſter <hi>Young</hi> wiſhed him to ſubmit himſelf, and to confeſs his fault towards Almighty God, he preſently
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98319:142"/>
with good words did it accordingly. Then Maſter <hi>Young</hi> told him that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Death unto all men, but unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in divers ſorts, and wiſhed him to take patiently that which God had laid upon him. This <hi>Hacket</hi> ſaid he would unfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, and withal asked the <hi>Queen's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Confeſſes the Fact, ſeems ſorry, and asks the Queen's Forgiveneſs.</note> Forgiveneſs; ſaying, he was very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the words he had ſpoken, and that it was a gracious and happy turn, that their Treaſons were in time revealed: For otherwiſe it would have coſt a number of innocent men their bloods, and himſelf (he thought) ſhould nevertheleſs alſo have been ſlain amongſt them: But now truſted in God that the others would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs alſo their Treaſons; and that her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> was a gracious Prince, and would forgive them if they asked mercy. And if it would alſo pleaſe her Highneſs to be ſo gracious unto him as to pardon him, he would henceforth become a good Subject. Furthermore (becauſe he had no Money) he then deſired Maſter <hi>Young</hi> either to give or to lend him ſome Money; ſaying he would repay it again if ever he were able, who thereupon did his devotion towards him. Then <hi>Hacket</hi> thanked him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Maſter <hi>Young</hi> to pray for him. Thus he continued in good Temper that night and the next morning, until (looking out at one of the Windows into the Street leading towards <hi>Cheapſide)</hi> he ſaw all the ſtreet even filled (as it were) up with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98319:143"/>
people, expecting his Execution. There <note place="margin">Seeing the Multitude waiting his Execution, he raves, and blaſphemes.</note> upon he began to anſwer ſuch as exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, very deſperately and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly: And when as coming down the Stairs one of the Sheriffs wiſhed him to be mindful of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, who ſuffered for him, he thereupon uttered moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Blaſphemy againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bleſſed Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>He was brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> towards the place of Execution, the Eight and twentieth day of <hi>July</hi> (being <hi>Wedneſday)</hi> after Ten of the Clock in the Morning, albeit by reaſon of the incredible multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude (then in the ſtreets) but eſpecially in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> from one end thereof unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (the like whereof at no aſſembly in memory hath been ſeen) it was very long ere the Officers (with all they could do) could get him to the very place. All the way that he was dragged upon the Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, he continued his counterfeit vein that he had then undertaken; one while cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Jehovab Meſſias, Jehovab Meſſias;</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">His extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Speeches going to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> another while crying out thus; Look, look, how the Heavens open wide, and the Son of God cometh down to deliver me. When he came under the Gibbet (which was reared hard by the Croſs in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> towards the right hand of the Street as you come from <hi>Paul</hi>'s) and the noiſe being appeaſed, he was exhorted to ask God and the <hi>Queen</hi> Forgiveneſs, and to fall to his Prayers: But he perſevering
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98319:143"/>
in his unprofitable courſe of diſſimulation, inſtead thereof, fell to railing and curſing of the <hi>Queen's Majeſty,</hi> moſt villanouſly. <note place="margin">He curſes the Queen.</note> But being more vehemently urged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his preſent ſtate, and to give over all hope to do himſelf good by ſuch diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, he began to pray this moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, blaſphemous, and execrable Prayer, viz. <hi>O God of Heaven, mighty Jebovah,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">His blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer.</note> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>Lord of Lords, King of Kings, and God everlaſting, that knoweſt me to be that true Jebovah, whom thou haſt ſent: ſend ſome miracle out of a cloud to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe Infidels, and deliver me from theſe mine enemies: If not, I will fire the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and tear thee from thy throne with my hands.</hi> With other words of moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable blaſphemy againſt the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God (not to be rehearſed) by reaſon that he found not that deliverance which he fancied God to have promiſed. Then turning towards the <hi>Executioner,</hi> he ſaid unto him, <hi>Ah thou baſtards chila, wilt thou</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">His words to the Hangman.</note>

Then he asked them (very
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98319:144"/>
fearfully) <hi>O what do you, what do you?</hi> but ſeeing by the circumſtance, what they intended, he began to rave again, and ſaid, <hi>Have I this for my kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">He dies hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> 
                           <hi>upon thee? I come to revenge thee, and plague thee;</hi> and ſo was turn'd off. But the people unwilling that ſo traitorous and blaſphemous a wretch, ſhould have any the leaſt favour: cried out mightily to have him cut down preſently, to be quartered, and ſeemed very angry with the Officers, that made no more haſte therein: but as ſoon almoſt as he was cut down, (even with a trice) his heart was taken forth, and ſhewed out openly to the people, for a moſt deteſtable, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Traytor's heart.</p>
                        <p>Thus died the moſt dangerous fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of ſedition, moſt deteſtable Traytor, moſt hypocritical ſeducer, and moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable blaſphemous hellhound, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages ever ſaw, or heard of, in this Land.</p>

A <hi>Lethargy</hi> is a notable forgetfulneſs of all things almoſt, that heretofore a man hath known, or of their names: ſo that ſuch one oftentimes forgetteth alſo his own name, calleth any thing by a wrong name; and beginning to ſpeak, forgetteth what he had ſaid afore, and what he meant to ſay after This diſtemperature and weakneſs cometh by ſome blow, ſickneſs, or age.</p>

Now then, to examine theſe three perſons by that which hath been ſaid: It may be yielded, that their imaginations, purpoſes, plots, and deſignments, reſpecting the weightineſs of the end and weakneſs of the means, were fantaſtical, unadviſed, and moſt fond and unlikely, yet none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than may be alſo truly ſaid for the moſt part of all ſuch fanatical fantaſticks, ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, hereticks, or malecontented treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable conſpirators whatſoever. But cannot (truly or with any colour of probability) be affirmed, that any of them were mad, beſides themſelves, and out of their wits, as not knowing and perceiving what they did or ſaid, or what others ſaid or did unto them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt concerning <hi>Arthington,</hi> I have not heard ſo much as any doubt at all of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have been made by any man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, or had to deal with him, either in or after this action. But becauſe <hi>Coppinger</hi> hath been ſuppoſed by many (after the time of his firſt examination) to have fallen into ſtark madneſs, let us a little look back, and briefly recapitulate ſome points, that have been afore touched concerning him, to ſee, if any ſuch diſtraction of mind could alſo be noted in him, by the carriage of this action, before his apprehenſion. Yet I do know, that it hath been doubted (upon ſome good ground) by wiſe men, whether he were indeed mad, even at any time after he was apprehended, as he made-ſhew, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98319:147"/>
whether it were only fained by him. For a mad man may, and often times doth, for two or three days together, eat no meat, nor happely drinks not at all. But when the humours of his ſtomach are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and put over, ſo that for want of food, it beginneth naturally to ſuck back the blood and nouriſhment, diſtributed afore into the veins and parts, which breedeth hunger: then will a madman (moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) very greedily and ravenouſly, even by courſe of nature, fall to his meat, if it be ſhewed him, and cannot abſtain, becauſe he cannot diſſemble this appetite, in the time of his fury. But <hi>Coppinger</hi> is ſaid to have forborn and abſtained from meat and drink (though they were offered unto him) by the ſpace of eight whole days: whereby he grew ſo weak, as that it may ſeem, he died for want of Suſtenance. Such reſolution or obduration of mind, can hardly ſo long together remain with him, that is mad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and knoweth not what he doth. Howſoever it were after, it is ſure, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Pageant was plaid, (wherein mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proſpered not as they expected) the whole courſe of his ſpeeches, writings, and other dealings were ſuch, as do argue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at all of reaſon, memory, wit, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſetting aſide the abſurdity and folly of the fancy, wherewith he was led.</p>

For when he firſt had taken apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch <hi>extraordinary</hi> calling, he yielded not ſtraightway and unadviſedly unto it, but after long and deliberate debating with himſelf: his care was great, and courſe (as in ſuch a matter) was conſiderate, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reſolved by ſuch, as he both then, and afore held, to be beſt able to judge of his gifts and calling: The queſtions that he framed were very pertinent to that purpoſe, and orderly penned: His Letters and ſpeeches to <hi>T.

For if in platting of his purpoſes, and dealing in the principal action, any thing of doubtful acceptance, ſhould happen to have been after diſcovered, then might he well and with good colour, have pretended, that he did it but in way of attaining to intelligence of thoſe dangers,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98319:148"/>
whereof the generality (as it were in the Clouds) he had afore delivered to a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.</hi> For he might not ſeem a man to be ſuſpected of any diſloyal purpoſe, who ſhewed himſelf ſo careful for his Sovereign's ſafety. Add to theſe, his cunning petition, to have priſoners for treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by himſelf, and execution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd perſons to be ſtai'd at his beck, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might more eaſily have induced them to appeach, whom he liſt to have overthrown, and whom he principally aimed at. His ſubtilty alſo doth notably appear in his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her <hi>Majeſty;</hi> where he makes ſhew of great ſecrets to be delivered only in her preſence, and prayeth to be pardoned, if in overmuch fear of her ſafety, he had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove that, which he could not, which argueth, that he had (indeed) not ſo much as any colourable intelligence delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, of Treaſon intended, by ſuch great men, as he pretended: but uſed this as a means, to have acceſs, for himſelf and the others, unto her Highneſs's preſence, for ſome further intended miſchief: Then his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and commendation of ſound and good counſel given him, by <hi>Eg.</hi> a preacher, and by others; his ſparing to reveal the great and dangerous ſecret unto <hi>Hacket,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their firſt acquaintance; his razing out of <hi>Hacket's</hi> and the Town's Name, out of the Letter ſent by him to a Noble perſonage, to give inkling of Treaſons intended againſt her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> leſt the quality and unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

                     <p>And concerning <hi>Hacket</hi> (whoſe terrible blaſphemies at the laſt, do argue either a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous diſſimulation to have his execution reſpited, or a deſperate intemperancy againſt God, for fruſtrating his expectation) there can no fury or madneſs be juſtly noted in him, by the whole managing of this action, but rather, notable hypocricy, craft, and diſſembled holineſs.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98319:150"/>
himſelf, and to terrify her <hi>Majeſty,</hi> by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (in generalities) of ſtrange judgments of God, imminent over her, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto him: that foreſeeing it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to rain (after a long time of drought) he prayed in <hi>Coppinger's</hi> preſence for rain, whereby it might ſeem to be ſent by God, at his only prayer and mediation: that he bare them in hand he could tell things to come, being merely contingent: that he could fain ſuch kind of <hi>Revelations,</hi> as if they were ſhewed to him in the midſt of his torments, (which if they be marked) tended only to have himſelf magnified, as a man placed moſt highly in God's favour: that when the one of his followers ſeemed offended, he craftely excuſed the miſlike which he had ſhewed, to hear her <hi>Majeſty</hi> prayed for: that the better to colour his hatred and malice, he afterwards prayed for her himſelf: that he cunningly induced <hi>Coppinger,</hi> either to fain or to fancy a Revelation, that he, and <hi>Arthington</hi> muſt obey him the ſaid <hi>Hacket</hi> in all things: that he pretended to diſpence with <hi>Arthington,</hi> for honouring him as King of <hi>Europe,</hi> until he ſhould do it before others, where it might ſtand him in better ſted: that he craftily put off his intended anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Coppinger,</hi> (as being already done in heaven) left ſome (unlooked for) acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happely falling forth, the whole page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant might have been marr'd: that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended greateſt office of ſevering (in Chriſt's behalf) the good from the bad, with his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98319:150"/>
Fan in his hand, was concealed from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington,</hi> until the very time that the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was to be done by them, when as it was too late to conſider of it, and unlawful to be diſobeied: that this office he procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto them (after his two ſolemn prayers, for direction of them by God's ſpirit, to the glory of God only) as it were an oracle newly dropped down from heaven: that he aſwered <hi>Wigginton's</hi> queſtions very cunningly, as touching the old Magiſtrates that were gone, and the new come in place, meaning thereby (in truth) the diſplacing of all her <hi>Majeſty's Councel:</hi> that he warily quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Coppinger's</hi> and <hi>Arthington's</hi> ſpeeches, which ſeem'd unto <hi>Wigginton,</hi> to attribute a little too much unto him: that (coming through the ſtreets, and ſeeing their proclamation had not made ſuch ſturr, as was hoped) he then pretended unto <hi>Wigginton</hi> that he had not ſet them on work, but marvelled what they meant thereby, and thereupon ſignified, he would depart the city, and be gone home: that fearing what might happen in the event of the tumult he ſent them into the ſtreets, but tarried behind in the Houſe himſelf: That he put the trial of his ſaid pretended great Office (which he claimed in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s room) upon this iſſue and trial, That none of the People which ſhould come to ſee him, had the power to kill him; for he knew that no private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might or would attempt to do it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever otherwiſe they took the matter. That
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98319:151"/>
after the matter fell not out to his purpoſe, and being returned to <hi>Walker</hi>'s Houſe, he rebuked <hi>Arthington's</hi> over-much forwardneſs, for calling him there (openly before others) the <hi>King of the Earth,</hi> and excuſed this in him, by his great Zeal. That he ſlily avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the queſtions which the Miniſter of that Pariſh did ask him, touching thoſe things which <hi>Arthington</hi> attributed unto him. That he uſed at his Examinations many crafty Evaſions; when any queſtion of capital dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him was asked. That he conſtantly at all his Examinations perſiſted in denying, and ſaid he did not remember that Action which ſeemed moſt odiouſly Traiterous, touching the piercing that part of the Picture which repreſented her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Royal Heart. That he denied alſo to have ſent them to publiſh as they did. That he did anſwer ſo doggedly and (in truth) kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly, to the queſtion of defacing the Lion and Dragon in her <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Arms. That to a queſtion (of moſt importance) whether her <hi>Majeſty</hi> were lawful <hi>Queen of England?</hi> he refuſed to anſwer. That he ſubtilly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (albeit not to the Lawfulneſs of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Queen)</hi> yet ſhe was (in fact) <hi>Queen</hi> as yet, <hi>if ſhe had not forfeited it.</hi> That when he was tortured, he revoked his Treaſons, and ſorrowfully ſubmitted himſelf; a courſe which by the extremity of Pain (at the firſt aſſaying of it) doth drive a man (being indeed mad) into a far greater rage and impatience than he was afore. That till he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98319:151"/>
was tortured, he would not appeach any other his Complices in the Treaſons. That being not willing to plead directly to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Indictment, he drave off the time with cunning Anſwers, indeed importing nothing leſs than madneſs. That being in good Temper, and (as ſeemed) well diſpoſed in mind both the Night before, and the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> morning, until he ſaw no remedy, but that he was preſently to be executed, he burſt not forth into his horrible Blaſphemies. And that at the very Execution, in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impatience pretended, (albeit his Speeches were moſt villanous againſt the Queen, and blaſphemous towards God) yet he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what was ſaid and done; his Words had Senſe, and his Prayer was coherent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, one part with another. None of all which things premiſed, can happen or be found in him that is indeed furious and diſtracted of his Wits; ſuch as the Laws not only do pity, but alſo ſpare and protect from all Puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>If any man now ſhall marvel how ſuch vain and fooliſh Conceits could ſo deeply poſſeſs men of any conſideration, let him remember what <hi>Luther</hi> writ againſt certain like Phanatical Perſons, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> who pretended like Purity, and intended alſo a dangerous Reformation: <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>none Error ſo abſurd, but (when God's Wrath is once kindled) the Devil is able to perſuade it.</hi>

Then he propounded unto their Reformed Preachers, certain Articles to be reſolved in <note place="margin">He propounds certain articles to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> by the Scriptures alone, by which, if they could not confute them, then he would (as

he ſaid) put them up unto the people, that by their authority they might be eſtabliſh'd. The effect of them was, that a man was not bound unto one wife, but might marry <note place="margin">One was about Bigamy:</note> ſo many as himſelf luſted. When their Preachers made ſome difficulty, and ſticking <note place="margin">They boggle.</note> at it, he called them into the <hi>Council-houſe,</hi> together with the Twelve new <hi>Governors-</hi>or <hi>Elders.</hi> Then he put off his Coat and laid it and the New Teſtament down together <note place="margin">He ſwears it is from God.</note> afore them, ſwearing by thoſe two (as by aſſured tokens) that the Articles by him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were revealed unto him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that God would never be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto them, if they did not yield unto them. Hereupon they gave their aſſents, <note place="margin">They aſſent.</note> and after (for three days together) they preached of nothing but of Marriage. Then <note place="margin">He marries three Wives.</note> 
                        <hi>Leyden</hi> married three Wives: one whereof was the Widow of their great Prophet <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> lately deceaſed, and divers other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <note place="margin">Others follow his example.</note> the like example, as if it had been a matter moſt allowable and laudable. But <note place="margin">Some Citizens abhorring the Practice, ſeize the Prophets.</note> ſome of the Citizens (of better diſpoſition) finding this courſe to be moſt abominable, gave a watch-word through the Town for all that truly favoured the Goſpel without fantaſtical Novelties, to come into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, where being aſſembled, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <hi>Leyden, Knipperdoling,</hi> and all the reſt of their <hi>Prophets.</hi> But when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people were advertiſed hereof, they <note place="margin">The People reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them and ſtay 50 of the Citizens.</note> ſtraightway took Arms, and reſcued the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners from them. The people alſo laid

hands on them, which had apprehended their <hi>Prophets,</hi> putting them to death with moſt exquiſite torments; namely, they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened fifty of them unto Trees, and ſhot at them with Harquebuzes, their great Prophet (all the while) crying thus unto them, That he that would do God good ſervice, ſhould firſt ſhoot at them; and others were put unto ſundry other ſeveral kinds of death.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>July</hi> that year, a new Prophet (being a Goldſmith by his Trade) <note place="margin">A Goldſmith.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98319:162"/>
compaſſed to be King, he firſt depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Twelve <hi>Governors,</hi> and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">He depoſeth the 12 Governors.

                        </note> the people thronged cloſe together about him, <hi>Knipperdoling,</hi> one of the Prophets, got upon the peoples heads, and ſo creeping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on his hands and feet, he breathed upon them in their mouths one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying thus: <hi>The Father hath ſanctified thee, receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Certain Weeks after, the new Prophet (afore mention'd) <note place="margin">The New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſummons the People to Arms.</note> cauſed (by ſound of a Trumpet) to be proclaimed, That all ſhould retire themſelves in Arms unto the Church-yard of the chief Church, for that the Enemy muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the Town.

                        <note place="margin">The King and Queen ſerve at Table.</note> alſo, and the chief <hi>Queen,</hi> together with their Courtiers did ſerve at table.

                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:98319:163"/>
and <hi>Luther</hi> were both falſe Prophets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Luther</hi> was the worſe.

Whileſt theſe things were thus in doing within and abroad, the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> was every day more and more ſtraitly beſieged, and preſſed with extreme famine; ſo that for fear leſt many the chief <hi>Burgers</hi> ſhould capitulate with the Enemy, and yield the <hi>King</hi> up unto the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> their <hi>King</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did chuſe Twelve, whom he held moſt faithful unto him, and appointed them to be Captains of War over ſo many ſeveral Parts of the Town, into which he did quarter it; entertaining the ſaid Twelve perſons with Mountains of large Promiſes, and telling them over what great Provinces and Dominions under him he would after <note place="margin">A Famine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth in the City.</note> place them. Thus the Famine ſtill more and more encreaſing in the City (ſo that ſundry died thereof, albeit the <hi>King</hi> had abundance for himſelf and his ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, not only for ſupply of neceſſity, but alſo to riot and banquet) it happened, that one of his <hi>Queens,</hi> in commiſeration of the diſtreſſed, ſaid unto the reſt, That ſhe could not believe it was the Will of God, that men ſhould in that ſort be ſuffered to die for want of food. Hereupon being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe was brought into the Market-place; and being commanded to kneel down, the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98319:164"/>
King ſtruck off her Head; all the reſt of his <hi>Queens</hi> ſinging, dancing, and giving thanks therefore to the <hi>heavenly Father.</hi> But whenas the common ſort had like to have mutined, <note place="margin">The King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imſeth them Deliverance before <hi>Eaſter.</hi> It not coming, he fains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſick, and puts a Cheat upon them.</note> by reaſon of the extremity of Famine, their <hi>King</hi> promiſed them aſſured deliverance from God before <hi>Eaſter.</hi> When <hi>Eaſter</hi> was come, no ſign or token of their deliverance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then the King feigned himſelf to be ſick for ſix days: afterward (aſſembling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the Market ſteed) he told them, that all that while he had ridden upon a blind Aſs, and that <hi>the Father</hi> had laid upon him the ſins of the whole Multitude, ſo that now they were cleanſed and freed from all Vice; which was the Deliverance which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto them, and therewith they were to hold themſelves contented. When the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>'s Strength, by common Supplies from the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> were much reenforced, matters (in the Town) grew to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that by means of two Perſons (who conveyed themſelves ſecretly forth of the Town) it was at laſt ſurprized by the <note place="margin">The City is ſurprized.

The three Perſons aforenamed were carried about the Countrey, as a Spectacle to ſundry
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98319:164"/>
the <hi>Princes</hi> and others thereabouts, and after were brought back again unto <hi>Munſter.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi> demanded of the <hi>King,</hi> by what Authority he took upon him to rule in that City? Who asked the ſaid <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> again, by what Authority he the ſaid <hi>Biſhop</hi> claimed any Power there? When he anſwered, that he had it by means of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and by Conſent of the People, the <hi>King</hi> replying, ſaid, That himſelf had his Authority from God. After two days had been beſtowed with them, to reduce them (by godly Perſuaſions) from their Errors, <hi>Leyden</hi> their <hi>King</hi> confeſſed his <note place="margin">Leyden <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi> Knipperdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>and</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliting <hi>arc obſtinate.

                        </note> Sin, and deſired Forgiveneſs at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hands. But <hi>Knipperdoling</hi> and <hi>Crecliting</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs no fault, but defended their courſe and Opinions with great Obſtinacy. So all Three being tied unto Poſts, were diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by piece meal, and pulled in ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with hot burning Pincers and Tongs, and afterward their Carkaſſes were hanged up there in Iron Cages; but the <hi>King</hi> in the midſt, and much higher than the other two, as his Place required.</p>
                     <p>Beſides certain eſpecial Opinions which <note place="margin">Some of their Erroneous and Heretical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</note> theſe <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> held, namely, <hi>That Young Children were not to be baptized;</hi> and <hi>touching Lawfulneſs of Poligamy, or having many Wives: Of Community of Goods;</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt took not Fleſh of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they alſo taught and defended many other ſtrange, erroneous, and heretical Poſitions: And yet
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98319:165"/>
they ſhewed as much Devotion, outward Holineſs and Purity, as might be. As for example; they held theſe following; <hi>viz. That a perfect Chriſtian might not exerciſe the Office of a Magiſtrate, nor might take an Oath before him. That God doth now oftentimes ſhew his Will by extraordinary Revelations, Dreams, and Viſions. That the common people have an eſpecial Authority in determining and eſtabliſhing of Church-cauſes. That before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be ſuch, as that the Godly and Elect ſhall overthrow and ſubdue all the wicked, and then they alone ſhall rule in the earth. That it is lawful for the People to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and put down the Prince or Magiſtrate. That Miniſters and others godly affected, ought to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh (though it were by Force) a Reformation in all Countries. That Princes and Magiſtrates ought not to purſue this kind of perſons, for that they are Innocents, and the beloved People of God. That the Seat of</hi> David <hi>which was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len down muſt be reeſtabliſhed, and that Chriſt now in the latter end of the World ſhall reign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally upon the Earth. That the time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege (they then lived in) was that where of</hi> Iſaiah <hi>propheſied, wherein the juſt and godly were afflicted and perſecùted. That the time of their deliverance and enlargement was at hand; which ſhould be like to that deliverance of the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>from the Thraldom under the</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians: <hi>And that then the wicked and ungodly ſhall receive the guerdon and recompence of all their Impieties committed againſt the Saints, all the ungodly being rid out of the way, the ſeat of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98319:165"/>
Righteouſneſs ſhould be prepared and advanced. That there is none efficacy or force in that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm wherewith Infants are baptized.</hi> All which they obſtinately defended; and yet (when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they were charged) they pretended that <hi>they would acknowledge and confeſs their Errors, if they ſhould be ſhewed unto them by the Scriptures, to be Errors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as I have done afore, in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">A compariſon of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> in <hi>Munſter</hi> with the <hi>Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in Opinion and Practice.</note> of <hi>Thomas Muncer,</hi> I muſt crave leave, that with the Readers patience, I may alſo briefly compare and reſemble ſome of the Dealings and Errors of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of the City of <hi>Munſter,</hi> with the actions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of theſe late Conſpirators, and of their <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> Schoolmaſters, from whom they have ſucked like Poyſon.</p>

theſe proceedings, before they make head, upon confidence of their multitudes? Have not all the ſtayed and ſound Preachers of this Land by ſundry <hi>Maleperts,</hi> and now again by <hi>Arthington,</hi> been (moſt inſolently) challenged unto diſputation? Hath not the cauſe of this pretended <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs quaſhed (oftentimes) in Pulpits, in publick diſputations in the Univerſities, and by learned treatiſes written: whereby the weakneſs, and meagerneſs of their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh collections, have been fully diſplayed? Will they make any haſt, or dare they to offer diſputation, if ſuch conditions, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, and indifferent and learned Judges as are fit, ſhall be ſet down and appointed? and (being beaten from their ordinary means) have not theſe Conſpirators, and ſuch as have animated them, betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto pretended <hi>extraordinary</hi> Callings, raviſhings in Spirit, carryings into Heaven, Revelations, Dreams and Viſions?

Had they not likewiſe appointed their Governors for matters of <hi>Counſel,</hi> and for other Civil Adminiſtration? Do not this kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo make ſhew of deſire to have all queſtions decided only by Scriptures? Doth not <hi>the Diſcipline</hi> give the chief and ſovereign allowance or diſallowance of all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal determinations, unto the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Did not theſe Conſpirators uſe (as means to be truſted, that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed ſuch things unto them) Oaths and Execrations of Damnation and Confuſion to themſelves, as deeply as <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> did, when he did ſwear by his Coat, and by the New Teſtament, touching the like Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did not <hi>Hacket</hi> their great <hi>Prophet,</hi> thirſt after, and threaten Revenge againſt ſome Great Perſons, who he thought did ſtand in his way? Did not <hi>Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> proclaim in the Market-place of <hi>Cheap,</hi> and afterward defend, That <hi>Hacket</hi> was <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Emperor</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and that God had ſo appointed it? Did they not hold, That he, together with themſelves, ſhould go forth, and take Poſſeſſion of all his Kingdoms here and abroad; and ſubdue all Kings that would not hold their Scepters of him, and be governed by ſuch Laws and Orders as he ſhould appoint; and that he ſhould ſever with his Fan the good from
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98319:168"/>
the bad, ſo that they ſhould not trouble and afflict the Godly any more? Had not <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo his ſaid <hi>Prophets</hi> to proclaim him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>John of Leyden</hi> had the Goldſmith? Did not <hi>Coppinger</hi> (upon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington</hi>'s Advertiſement) with three moſt lowly Obeiſances, and with great Gravity, take upon him, and was ready to anoint and ſanctify <hi>Hacket</hi> with the Holy Ghoſt, but that (by a ſhift) he was put off? And as they of <hi>Munſter</hi> had their prophane and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Celebration of the Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſent forth their Twenty eight Preachers; in like manner, Had not theſe their Hypocritical Faſts and Prayers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated and made known unto ſundry of their own diſpoſition, that they might join (either in Body or Spirit) with them, afore they enterprized any matter, or entred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of weight, or would aſſume their ſuppoſed <hi>extraordinary</hi> Callings? Do not theſe and all like affected to them, by their Teachers in every Corner, ſeek to win or perſuade as many to the liking of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as poſſibly they can any way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and hem in? Have they not alſo their ſet, empty, thundring Words, and ſolemn Obteſtations, to allure men to believe that which they teach? Did not the ſaid two <hi>Engliſh Prophets</hi> offer by their Proclamation great Mercy and Joys to them that ſhould believe or follow them; and infinite Woes and Damnation to thoſe that ſhould reject
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98319:168"/>
them? Did they not ſignify, That the time was come for the eſtabliſhing the Goſpel and <hi>Reformation</hi> by their King <hi>Hacket;</hi> and therefore willed all true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be of good comfort, becauſe the Wicked ſhould be overthrown? Did they not engage their Lives, yea, and Souls, upon the Verity of the Meſſages that they publiſhed? And were they not a good while (after their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) very obſtinate and reſolute in their Fancies conceived? Was not <hi>Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s Promiſes of ſpeedy Deliverance unto <hi>Udall,</hi> as confident and reſolute as <hi>John of Leyden</hi>'s was unto the People of that City? Though the Event ſhewed, that at laſt all did but come to the <hi>riding of a blind Aſs?</hi> Did not <hi>Hacket</hi> likewiſe blaſphemouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That by the whipping which <hi>Pigge</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, he did ſuffer for the ſins of all Hypocrite Preachers, ſuch as favoured <hi>the Diſcipline,</hi> but were not ſo forward as he thought they ought to be? Was not the reſolution of one of theſe as lewd as <hi>Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s (who after all hope was paſt, ran amongſt the armed Companies) if he alſo did (as was ſaid) with like wilfulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take any Suſtenance? Was not the deſperateneſs of <hi>Hacket</hi> alſo moſt horrible and fearful, whenas (ſeeing no Remedy but Death) he opened his mouth blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly againſt Heaven, and againſt the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the Eternal God?</p>

And concerning certain opinions of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> do not many of the <hi>Diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narian</hi> humour, come far nearer unto them than were to be wiſhed? for though they deny not the Civil Magiſtrates ſuperiority altogether, yet in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, though they admit it (in words) they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unto him nothing elſe but execution of their Orders, without attributing any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior preheminence of commandment in Church-cauſes, for retaining of good order, and of ſoundneſs of Doctrine in the Church. Likewiſe, though they take not the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty from the chief Magiſtrate in cauſes of the Common-wealth, do they not ſo abridge and bound his Authority in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, that the very <hi>Papiſts</hi> do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as much in this behalf unto him, as they do? And albeit they will not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in judgment deny the lawfulneſs of an Oath before a Magiſtrate, yet if their ſundry and variable Poſitions in this point be marked, they do (in effect wholly) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the uſe of it. For do not ſome of them plainly refuſe to take an Oath, whereby they may be urged to diſcover any thing which may either be penal to themſelves, or to their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Brother, and ſo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deny it altogether? Do not others of them refuſe to tell any thing that is criminal concerning any other perſon, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they will do it againſt themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they think it is afore diſcovered
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98319:169"/>
and known? Do not ſome of them refuſe an Oath ſimply, yea, and to anſwer (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oath) either affirmatively or negatively, but do will their accuſers to ſtand forth. Do not others deny to take an Oath, except every particular queſtion be afore made known unto them? a matter impoſſible, becauſe ſundry Queſtions that ſhall be asked, do ariſe forth of the matter of the Anſwer? And do not ſundry of them (albeit they yield to detect by Oath both their own and others offences) yet deny to reveal any thing whereof they are asked, if themſelves be perſuaded the matter demanded of, be none offence? And ſo they do hang obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Laws, Allegiance and Duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, upon every particular mans conceit, even as he by circumſtances, or his own fond perſuaſion, ſhall liſt to meaſure matters. Do they not reſolutely hold, that <hi>ſumma poteſtas,</hi> the Chief and Sovereign Power in all Church-cauſes, belongs to a Presbytery, who though they may conſult, yet may not determine matter of any moment, without the allowance of the People? Had not theſe Conſpirators a like opinion to thoſe of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> that the principal ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (being in <hi>Hacket)</hi> he was come with his Fan to ſever and diſpatch out of the way all the wicked and ungodly, from the good and godly? Hath it not been ſet down by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubject, and twice printed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular allowance of the Engliſh <hi>Arch-Prophet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98319:170"/>
of diſcipline,</hi> for Sound and <hi>Holy Divinity,</hi> that it is God's ordinance, to have in every Kingdom certain chief Officers (like <hi>Ephori</hi> in <hi>Lacedoemon)</hi> who ſhould have authority to depoſe Kings, though they come unto it by lawful Succeſſion, if they ſhall judge them to be Tyrants? Did not <hi>Wigginton</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver for ſound Doctrine, That if the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> did not govern well, the people might draw themſelves together, and to ſee a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</hi> Do not theſe kind of perſons likewiſe ſlander the <hi>Prince</hi> and State, with perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, and of innocent men, becauſe they are a little reſtrained from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on in their Seditious courſes? Did not theſe Conſpirators alſo hold, That now in theſe latter times, <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his principal ſpirit (imparted unto <hi>Hacket)</hi> ſhould reign and erect an external kingdom on earth, and in the world? And did they not fancy, that even at that time the Goſpel with their <hi>diſcipline,</hi> ſhould be univerſally eſtabliſhed, and all the ungodly aboliſhed? Do not all of the <hi>Diſciplinarian</hi> Sect hold, that to the very being of Baptiſm (and without which, it is of no more force in any caſe, than the Nurſes waſhing) it is required, that it be adminiſtred by a lawful Miniſter? thereby derogating, not only from the true Baptiſm of Thouſands, but alſo of all whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that were Baptized by Popiſh Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Prieſts themſelves, and from all that have received Baptiſm of ſuch as were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98319:170"/>
by them? whereupon muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low neceſſity of <hi>Rebaptization,</hi> or elſe that it were lawful to neglect and contemn that Sacrament, and high Myſtery of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, Do they not make great ſhews, and many pretences, for all their unſound and abſurd Opinions, that they are taken from the holy and ſacred written word of God? which by this means they make to be of private interpretation, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their ſenſes unto it, when they read, but do wickedly captivate the Scripture unto their own ſenſes and meanings? even as (in this behalf) <hi>Coppinger</hi> or <hi>Arthington</hi> did firſt take upon them an <hi>extraordinary</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note place="margin">Scripturas ad ſuum non ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſenſum ad Scripturas adducunt.</note> and were afterwards charged by <hi>Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et</hi> to read over the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> there to find an approbation of it.</p>

                        <hi>God of his infinite mercy forgive, and turn the hearts of all that trouble his Church, fromrunning well, or that impugne his Ordinance, and ſuch as are ſet over them: and reſtrain, or root out all Phantaſtical Errors and Fanatical ſpirits, which the envious man (from time to time) doth ſow among the good Wheat: that holding the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, we may all meet together (in the unity of faith, and knowledg of the Son of God) unto a perfect man, and unto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſs of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and ſo ſpeedily and joyfully meet him our Bridegroom in the Clouds, with our heads lifted up, and full of Comfort, and ſo reign
